The first thing the public needs to do is understand that you cannot get the flu from a flu vaccine  You may feel yucky and have some mild side effects but it is not the flu  Understand what the symptoms of the flu are  Sudden onset of illness fever of over 101 and generalized achiness along with uper respiratory symptoms   if you have any type of reaction from the flu vaccine you need to get in touch with your doc immediately  Flu vaccines are preventative if you don't care if you get the flu think of your family and friends  Normal influenza kills 30000 people a year in the US alone  Research it and understand the facts not what you hear from your neighbors  I plan on getting vaccinated as soon as it is available as well as my children grandchildren and husband

Flu vaccines do not protect people from flu-related deaths The CDC claims that an astonishing 36000 people die from flu in an average year  Butaccording to the former Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy Thompson 68people under 65 die from flu each year in the US  The truth is that in 4 years a total4440 people mostly elderly died from flu no where near the CDC’s touted 144000deaths  While that figure is great for flu vaccine sales it derivers not from reality butfrom the CDC’s industry-friendly statistical trick of classifying all pneumonia-relateddeaths despite any lack of evidence as flu deaths  Discussing this nonsense LoneSimonsen of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease/NIH writes in TheArchives of Internal Medicine We could not correlate increasing vaccination coverageafter 1980 with declining mortality rates in any age group  Because fewer than 10% of allwinter deaths were attributable to influenza in any season we conclude that observationalstudies substantially overestimate vaccination benefit

Vaccine that works without complication is a major factor in preventing a disease against which a vaccine is supposed to work but there are several effective measures that could be taken to prevent infection that reduces the reliability of and dependability on a vaccine  Most of us will not infected with certain viral infections without having received a vaccine to prevent those infections

Can we assume that these vaccines will provide us any protection at all? Perhaps but it’s not likely  First clearly understand that under BARDA you may be (legally) subjected to experimental drugs – drugs which have no track record at all – and second with or without the advent of BARDA it is now more important than ever that the real truth about vaccines be widely and quickly disseminated  There are reported to be more than 200 new vaccines “in the pipeline”  If they along with the ones in use now are not safe we and our children are not safe  All of us have been carefully conditioned to believe that vaccines are safe  But the truth is ugly and with BARDA staring us in the face more than a little frightening  The concept of informed consent is of course is meaningless in the face of compulsory vaccination with secret ingredients and no manufacturer accountability

Doran you are not going to be the one responsible for disseminating truth about vaccines  That needs to be qualified medical professionals not news blog scare-tacticians  Your story continues to change with every comment and you continue to be woefully misinformed  The Biomedical Advanced Research and Developmental Authority isn't making vaccines mandatory  It has no authority to do so because it's a bureaucratic body not a legislative one  BARDA's involved with lots more than vaccines  If we're attacked with chemical nuclear or biological weapons BARDA's the organization that would help us respond  If you're so frightened of the government pharmaceutical manufacturers and their malevolently intended vaccines why are you not packing your bags to move? I'd like to see you back away from the keyboard right now so you don't waste a moment more on beginning your journey elsewhere

People need to wake up and study this on their own  Do you honestly think that the government is going to tell you the real story? It's not so much that one is being added it's WHICH ONE is being added  The following is a small part of what this contains  According to Meryl Nass M D “A novel feature of the two H1N1 vaccines being developed by companies Novartis and GlaxoSmithKline is the addition of squalene-containing adjuvants to boost immunogenicity and dramatically reduce the amount of viral antigen needed  This translates to much faster production of desired vaccine quantities “Research shows that squalene is the experimental anthrax vaccine ingredient that caused devastating autoimmune diseases and deaths for many Gulf War veterans from the US UK and Australia yet it continues in use today and for new vaccines development in labs” writes Stephen Lendman According to award-winning investigative journalist Gary Matsumoto there’s a “close match between the squalene-induced diseases in animals and those observed in humans injected with this oil: rheumatoid arthritis multiple sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus A study linking squalene as experimental vaccine adjuvant to individuals with the clinical signs of Gulf War syndrome was published in 2002  The published findings strongly suggest that the squalene contaminated vaccines could be responsible for the Gulf War Syndrome symptoms seen in the study group and recommended that a large scale epidemiological study be performed to verify or correct this [4] Despite repeated assurances that the vaccine was safe and necessary a U S  Federal Judge ruled that there was good cause to believe it was harmful and he ordered the Pentagon to stop administering it in October 2004 If a Federal judge thought it was so dangerous then why is it still used and being forced on our children?

* Congress is on its August Recess and you can easily visit your Congressmen and women in their home districts to explain why you want the right to self shield rather than be forced to take a vaccine or be incarcerated* The dangerous Swine Flu vaccine is being tested on children and pregnant women* NOT for safety but for dosage and has not yet been deployed on a mandatory basis * The Senate has not yet voted on the total give-away of our food supply to the very forces that are killing us with dangerous and unsafe food Agribiz* Every Member of Congress can be educated about the importance of HR 3394 and 3395 in protecting both our health our health freedom and our Constitutional right to free speech  Right now you have an outstanding opportunity to act decisively and powerfully to speak for Liberty and protect her - and yourself  The next three weeks while Congress is on recess can be the time when we the net roots of health freedom act in such compelling numbers that we do indeed protect our health and our freedom from the forces that are trying to overwhelm both of them  We have managed to get almost 2 million emails to congress and the senate and our push back efforts are working we have to stay focused and not let those who would be willing to give up their rights effect our efforts  No flu vaccine EVER has been proven to be safe or effective  Doesn't take a medical professional to know that

You're full of baloney Doran  Absolutely full of it  Thankfully no thinking person can take you seriously  As a whole flu vaccines are still much safer than the diseases they protect against although it’s a fact that they’re not 100% effective against any flu  And you and others will never be forced to take a vaccine or incarcerated if you don't  Several days ago incidentally you told everyone they'd be forced to take a vaccine or else be quarantined or incarcerated against their will  When you find out who's going to do the enforcement of these sinister vaccine laws and enlarge the jails to accommodate criminal vaccine-refusers you be sure and let us know  Your alleged letter-writing campaign incidentally appears to be doing absolutely nothing stem the development of vaccines or plans to respond to the swine flu  Why is that?

I've truly tried to put up the laws governing pandemics as stated by WHO CDC NIH but with little support from big media because its very scary and controversial  I'll get some of this up if I can  WHO’s International Health Regulations (IHR) are legally binding upon all 194 signatory countries including the US  If WHO advises mandatory vaccination under the IHR the US would be obligated to reverse its current stand and require mandatory vaccination for the Swine Flu Level 6 Pandemic  US Legal exemptions for self shielding but not for medical conditions would we believe trump this requirement since we believe legal action by the US BEFORE mandatory vaccination is invoked would give the US legal authority to allow self shielding without violating international law

A novel feature of the two H1N1 vaccines being developed by companies Novartis and GlaxoSmithKline is the addition of squalene-containing adjuvants   ~~~~~~~~~~Squalene has been used for years in Europe and Africa  It is not novel and it is not new  It just hasn't been used in very many US vaccines to date ______________“Research shows that squalene is the experimental anthrax vaccine ingredient that caused devastating autoimmune diseases and deaths for many Gulf War veterans~~~~~~~~~The purported link between GWS and squalene is tentative and needs much more investigation  Some research studies have found anti-squalene antibodies in those suffering from Gulf War Syndrome  Nothing conclusive has been determined as to their role in GWS  Such antibodies would be expected in those who've been given an injection containing the substance as an adjuvant  Their presence doesn't mean they necessarily caused disease  It is certainly an error at this point to say it has been proven that squalene caused devastating autoimmune diseases and deaths for many Gulf War veterans  It would be appropriate to say the substance is being investigated as to its role if any in GWS

No flu vaccine EVER has been proven to be safe or effective  Posted by: doranpalmer 12:28 PM  ~~~~~~~~~~~You've apparently haven't done your homework  This statement is blatantly false  Before influenza vaccines were introduced in the 1940s influenza was either the #1 #2 or #3 most frequent cause of mortality in Americans  Upon introduction of the vaccine influenza deaths dropped off dramatically and have never again been in the top 5 causes of American deaths  The difference: Before vaccine availability 80000 to 120000 people died each year of influenza  Now the death rate is less than 30000 in a much larger population  Effectiveness has been clearly established by these epidemiological data and numerous research studies  As for safety over the past 30-odd years less than 500 people have died as the result of getting a flu shot and between 40 and 80 million people get one every year  That's a case fatality rate far below NOT getting the vaccine and being susceptible to influenza

Minorkey1 - You are absolutely correct  I don't believe we could know the true numbers  As you said so many are not tested after death for influenza viruses  Which in my opinion they should be and we should be tracking where they are going and trying the figure where they are coming from  Unfortunately there is no way to create a vaccine for any of them because they mutate much to quickly which is why no vaccine has ever been effective against influenza viruses

Doran you continue to write science-fiction  And you're still not persuading anyone capable of critical thinking  Cite your academic resources please on your claim that the reason humans are less susceptible to the flu is because of the cleaner environments we live in  The legitimate medical community will confirm for you that the reason we see less flu is because of vaccinations themselves  Viruses mutate it's true  Different viruses do so at different speeds  Flu vaccines still provide significant effectiveness against them even with mutation  Thank you MinorKey for your efforts here in combating medical folklore and scare-tactics  I shake my head at the volume of nonsense Doran manufactures

@ babyof12 -- You should practice what you preach with regard to researching and understanding facts  The CDC's claim of +36000 flu deaths/year is debunked on its own Web site  See www cdc gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr56/nvsr56_16 pdf   Table 2 sets forth combined influenza and pneumonia deaths then individual influenza death counts and pneumonia death counts  In case you (or other interested parties) don't have time to look it up the combined flu/pneumonia death count in 2006 was 56247 of which 55387 were caused by pneumonia and a mere 860 by influenza  For 2005 the numbers were combined at 63001 pneumonia at 61189 and flu at 1812  Look it up for yourself if you doubt my word

I would never take a swine flu vaccine  The best way to stay healthy is to have a health clean lifestyle  If a more dangerous virus spreads later on then the best course of action is just to isolate yourself until it's over  You can read more online about how the 1976 swine flu vaccine actually caused more deaths than the actual flu

Even if we fully understood the immune system and the full spectrum of deleterious effects of foreign antigens and other toxic substances such as vaccine and drug adjuvants and medications on the immune system of humans and particularly on the immature immune system of babies and small children  Injecting any foreign substance straight into the bloodstream will only cause anaphylactic (sensitization) reactions  Nature over hundreds of thousands of years has developed effective immune responses; yet man without respect for nature demonstrably causes more harm than good Vaccination procedures are a highly politically motivated non-science whose practitioners are only interested in injecting multitudes of vaccines without much interest or care as to their effects  Data collection on reactions to vaccines is only paid lip service and the obvious ineffectiveness of vaccines to prevent diseases is glossed over The fact that natural infectious diseases have beneficial effect on the maturation and development of the immune system is ignored or deliberately suppressed Consequently parents of small children and any potential recipients of vaccines and any orthodox medications should be wary of any member of the medical establishment (which is little more than a highly politicized business system) extolling the non-existent virtues of vaccination  Even though the law requires doctors to warn patients about all side-effects of all medications and procedures of a material nature whether the patient asks or not doctors as a rule do not uphold this important law

If a more dangerous virus spreads later on then the best course of action is just to isolate yourself until it's over ~~~~~~Except that this plan of action is not feasible unless you lock yourself in a bunker somewhere with enough food water and other supplies to last you for about 3 years (2-3 years with several strong waves of disease is the normal duration of a pandemic)  Even then when you come out the virus will still be around and as an unvaccinated and immunologically naive person lacking resistance to it you'll be likely to catch it ___________ You can read more online about how the 1976 swine flu vaccine actually caused more deaths than the actual flu Posted by:RaCOno1584 3:47 PM~~~~~~And neither the 1976 swine flu strain nor its vaccine nor both together killed anywhere near as many people as have already died from pandemic H1N1 2009  In fact if you add up all the deaths from all the flu vaccines ever produced it would come to about 1/4 of the number of people who've been killed by the 2009 pandemic virus since April  As to whether this virus is dangerous perhaps you ought to visit flucount org to gain a little perspective  This virus should be taken seriously

Realitybit this isn't a man-made virus  It's pig-made like lots of viruses are  Pigs are great viral incubators and viruses have a marvelous ability to swap genes inside pig cells  This one has been identified as a triple-reassortant virus a three-fer bug that combined genes from a seasonal human virus (part of the H3N2 family) with a North American bird virus and a classic swine flu virus  That bug had probably been circulating among pigs for a long time—as much as a decade—before it combined sometime last year with two other types of pig viruses and then acquired the ability to jump to humans  It’s a mostly swine virus that also contains elements of bird and human viruses  Doran you’ll forgive me if I continue to call you on your baloney  Those are not academic sources on why a cleaner environment is responsible for less flu development! Not even close  They’re a thrown-together hodge-podge of your continuing attempts at credibility many of which don’t have anything even remotely to do with the flu itself  I’ll give you one thing; you are highly entertaining  Incidentally it's a waste of time not a waist  See why you're not to be taken seriously?

Adjuvants boost the immune system but once begun they keep working even if the effect is to work against your own body  That happens with some people but not all; the question is which ones are susceptible? There's no way to tell in advance  If you or your children are in the unlucky group you may develop a life-long autoimmune disease such as lupus  The adjuvant that's being considered is MF59 containing squalene  Safety claims are based on it's having been used in skin creams not injection  My family will not accept an adjuvanted vaccine Read scientific research on adjuvants by Googling: adjuvant autoimmunity site:ncbi nlm nih govRead a discussion of vaccines and adjuvants here: http://www newfluwiki2 com/diary/3654/mass-vaccination-against-swine-flu-h1n1-in-the-us

The adjuvant that's being considered is MF59 containing squalene  Safety claims are based on it's having been used in skin creams not injection ~~~~~~~~~False  squalene has been used in injections in Europe and Africa (for instance the malaria vaccine among others)  Squalene may be FOUND in other products but that is not the basis upon which vaccine manufacturers are basing their safety claims ~~~~~~My family will not accept an adjuvanted vaccine ~~~~~~~~This is always your choice and it seems to be one made in the absence of weighing your RELATIVE risks for each course of action  Before deciding not to get a flu shot you might want to wait for the results of the clinical testing now underway and the determination of which vaccines will contain adjuvant  Usually different vaccine makers have different formulations some which may be adjuvanted and some which may not be  If a vaccine is available w/o adjuvant consider getting that one if you can

Adjuvants with current Novel Flu vaccine contain squalene a toxic and deadly vaccine booster Among other ingredients in many vaccines ( although not all of these are included the Nove Flu vaccine but many vaccines have several of these) Adjuvants are: formaldehyde thimerosal aluminum hydroxide aluminum phosphate sorbitol hydrolized gelatin polysorbate 80 gelatin formalin monkey kidney cells ammonium sulfate washed sheep red blood cells glycerol sodium chloride pancreatic hydrolysate of casein phenoxyethanol human diploid cells neomycin polymyxin embryonic fluid (chicken egg)  tri(n)butylphosphate phenol and capsular polysaccharides etc etc  Several of these are usually found in any type of vaccine  Dr  Evangelista (former FDA investigator)

I have never had a vaccine shot my children are all homeopathically immunized  None of us has ever gotten the flu As a child I was vaccinated for rubella I got rubella to this day I am always told I am not immune to rubella Commercials on other kinds of vaccines telll us not everyone will be protected and you can still get whatever  So why bother if the science is not exact? I would prefer to build up my immunity from all foriegn bodies naturally and take my chances  If I die at least it is my choice and no one to blame but me and I have no problem being accountable to myself

NO WAY PEOPLE! You should not take this Swine Flu Shot or any other one  My brother was forced to take this in the service in 1978 after it had killed a lot of people the government was still giving it out to them  He has since went from a 206 lbs fully built man of 6'5 down to 140 lbs and became almost paralized w/guillian - beaure' syndrome  His nerves and skin were on end you could'nt even touch him  Then the unthinkable happened he had a nervous breakdown and they dianosed him through the VA that he is paranoid schitzophrenic!

Ahhh yeah efectiveness responds to an increase in antibody production not effective at stopping the disease  CDC definitin  Check the literature and discover that high anitibody counts does not protect compared to those people who do not have a high antibody count  Cell mediated immune resopne is important and seems to be forgotten at the chase of increased anntibodies   And you have explained what and why the use but have not discussed their effects  Not so hot in Rats they all develop disease and die  Why do we use rats oh yeah becuase they have a similar physiology to ours so we can extrapolate the effects   Why not look and relfect upon the last swine flu in the 1970's sad but true that more people died and were disabled from the vaccine that the actual flu

what really gets me is why did they wait until the last minute to start making this vaccine cause they knew about the outbreak in the other part of the world  and also there are enough pharmaceutical companies in the country to make plenty of any medication that we would need  i dont understand why this always happens every time we have a epidemic of any sort  it like the US is never ready for anything that comes about suddenly  even though they are putting on all the huppla about safety precautions and such  with the money that is made off of medications in this country and all the different facilities that pump out meds everyday  our country is a bureaucratic joke as far as im concerned  and now our president has decided he wants to take away everyones freedom  i knew once he got into office things would get ugly  the majority of the people that voted him in only did it because of his race  they did not listen to anything he had to say  now we are in a big crisis  this health care reform is a big fat joke  the gov  is slowly but surely taking over and trying to own everything  communism is on its way into our lives! i wish everybody could see that and realize what is really going on!

   and btw YumYum and the rest of you- Thimerisol = mercury  You think Aluminum is bad? (and it is) but Mercury will damage your family for life if you don't watch out and take care Ever wonder how the pharma companies can make a single version of a shot and expect it to work for the masses as diverse as they are? Do clothing stores only sell one size of pants? Why do they ad adjuvants to shots (which make smaller amounts of antigens work better  )    yep you guessed it: FOR PROFIT  This whole thing is for profit  How many people do YOU know that have died from Swine Flu compared to the generic flu? Hmmmm   ?don't do it I was quit curious of your comment mtnmandoc not disputing just interested  I went to the FDA site  They confirm that only Aluminum Salts are allowed in Vaccines in the US as an adjuvant  However preservatives are added to vaccine preparations to help minimize the consequences of inadvertent microbial contamination; with certain exceptions they are required by regulation for multi-dose formulations  There are four preservatives that are currently contained in U S  licensed vaccines  These are: thimerosal phenol 2-phenoxyethanol and benzethonium chloride  Other countries are not regulated by the FDA and have more adjuvants then the US Posted by:YumYumTree Aug-12Mark As Violation

My concern is the reports I have been hearing about the number of research and medical microbiologists over recent years who have been killed by accidents or suicides  I understand some of these scientists were the very ones we would need for an independent analysis of the current vaccines and pandemics and the ones who could independently develope antidotes in vaccines for the vaccines we are receiving  It is just perplexing  I think of the British scientist who committed suicide in the woods in England not too many years ago  Is there anything to this?

I'v taken the time and read everyones comments and all though all I will admit have some merite as we all are welcome to our opion  I have to say that Yes everyone has the right to take this shot Noone is being forced All clinical research trials are voulantairy and anyone can leave or withdral consent whenever and for whatever reason they see fit  All pharmacutical company's will provide and pay for all medical Adveres events as well as serious advers events that happen while participating in a clinical research trial As well cover medical expenses for any life threating or life altering effect a vaccine can have  What most people dont understand is that clinical research trials go through phases and can take up to 7 years and 1 7 billion dollars to bring a drug to market which is because every potential drug goes through extensive testing to ensure it will have the least amount of harm it can on the public  If were not for clinical research trials like this one we would not have tylonol and or motrin or everyday over the counter medications which by the way all have side affects( even taking motrin can cause blindness in children and advil can cause reyes syndrom) everything causes something but its about the relife of one thing for another Everyone has a choice I will take the side affect of being sleepy if it will help my runny nose and head ache go away Wouldnt you?? Clinical research trials are being conducted to find new ways to help amearicans and people everywhere over come disease and everyday life altering conditions and without them we would all be dead right now So think about your comments research clinical research trials research diffrent medications and all the people they help every year we only hear the bad things because today thats all americans want to look at but at it with the glass half full instead of half empty and maybe you can see the up side to vaccines and clinical research trials

IMHO the true issue at hand regarding mandatory H1N1 vaccinations is whether or not our government is truly acting responsibly in our best interest or is this just another case where its public policy is being directed by insensitive mega-national corporations with their own agendas where our welfare is at stake  Based on the most recent government regulatory oversight debacals of our financial institutions and Wall Street and the combined misrepresentations by our nation's leadership of the urgent need cost and length of the Iraq and Afghan wars that have offered little to us in the way of reduced energy costs by way of oil field control or reductions in Jhihadist threats or training camps one may want to ask why we should NOW trust our government to our personal safety with a vaccine that was rushed to development resulting in a one size fits all vaccine backed up by very limited human test trials  So where did it all go so horribly wrong for our society leading to as many as 30% of us succumbing to a global flu pandemic over the next few years as waves of its mutant strains decend upon us  Could it be that we in America are simply a vicitm of our own success and as a free people we stand in the way of the New World Order agenda that feels threatened by our innate rugged individualism that represents the last bastion of hope to free people everywhere?Perhaps this is true and our beholding government has no choice but to be complicit to the globalists scheme to conserve resources and their collective futures by rapidly reducing our numbers with a pandemic that forces mandatory vaccinations (or risk losing your medicare social security benefits and other government entitlements if you refuse inocculation) which may become the justification for Marshall Law  If this comes to pass with H1N1 then those who cannot prove they have been vaccinated may find themselves hauled away and quarantined in remote military encampments

Another interesting aspect of H1N1 is the way it seems to be more aggressive in the wya it attacks younger and presumably healthier adults  Could it be that the new vaccine will actually contain an immuno-suppressant component to reduce over-active immune system responses to H1N1 in this age group? Would such a component make this group more vulnerable to less serious seasonal flu attacks or possible food-borne viruses? As many others suggest with their comments the CDC figures for flu deaths from seasonal flu seem unusually low especially considering that many seasonal flu cases do result in pneumonia which is the CDCs major cause of death among the elderly and infants  Clearly pneumonia itself may be a direct result of an over-active immune system as fluids needed to clear our systems of invading pathogens are collected in the lungs where they are not easily expelled and often result in pneumonia-like conditions that may lead to death  As a victim of such a condition a few years ago where my life was threatened by it I was lucky enough to discover on my own a good technique to clear the lungs of fluids  This is also something that none of my health-care professionals ever advised me to do which seems baffling to me as to why they didn't The technique is simple since it only requires one who is afflicted to bend at the waist and lean over the back of a chair as it presses on the belly and cough gently or more vigorously if tolerated to quickly expel fluids from the lungs and out of the mouth into a cup  This may be repeated as lungs gurgle and need clearing again  By bending over fluids are free of the force of gravity and very light coughing is only needed to remove the fluid in no time and greatly improve breathing and chances for recovery  If one chooses a mild anti-biotic may also be taken to reduce the risk of bacterial lung infection while in recovery from pneumonia which can be a more serious condition and not as easily treated

Of particular concern to me is the one size fits all approach to the H1N1 vaccine since I have -AB blood type which means I don't do as well as a most in metabolizing nutrients in certain foods that I eat  Each of us are as biologically unique by our genetics as there are no two snowflakes that are alike so until we have genetically engineered treatments designed for our particular genetic codes one may want to be a bit more cautious with what is introduced into our systems  Also I think it is high time we took a different approach to our relationship with the government to see if we can discover a way where they begin to see us as a more valuable ally rather than selling out to the interests of corporations that grease their wheels with perks and buckets of campaign money to ensure their place in power and history  If we cannot win them to our side then we are at their mercy and we will have no one to blame but ourselves for our future fates As to how we may accomplish such a feat some suggest another revolution is the only way  IMHO I believe there is another way that may eliminate the need for that insane scenario which is to create a new virtual society online that draws on the imagination and creativity of all whom are interested in suggesting fresh ideas and policies for our government leaders to consider as we move forward into the 21st Century  By using this apporach the best ideas for our future society may be discovered voted on and presented to our leaders as a new virtual world that reflects the needs of all concerned  Perhaps a simple declaration of values and personal rights for all people on Earth may be a starting point with all other laws business regulations and commerce ideas embracing those rights and values  As always we continue to live in tenuous and treacherous times where the value of human life may only be worth a few bucks in many third-world countries and possibly our own some day soon

Excuse me? You failed to talk about Thimerosal and mercury  It is known fact that flu immunizations contain these toxic adjuvants and that these chemicals have been at the center of the autism controversy for over twenty years  While flu immunizations may have minimal damaging effects on the adult brain they are notorious for stripping myelin from Purkinje neurons and micro-tubules in young children  This impacts Purkinje action potential thus producing both a neurological processing disorder and it's co-occurring panic and these problems can never be corrected

It is absolutely madness to do large scale (tens of millions of people starting with children) vaccination with vaccines that have not been thoroughly tested and not just for two weeks but for several months  As long as there is a question as to whether Gulf War Syndrome was caused by the adjuvant squalene or one of its molecular variants there should be no further use of squalene-based adjuvants until proven safe  This has not been done EVER  The Pentagon has a poor history of claiming that there was no squalene in the anthrax vaccine given to our troops when it was found later to have lied lied lied  300000 casualties from these vaccines makes GWS the largest friendly fire incident in the history of warfare  The sufferers are still committing suicide at a rate of thousands per year  So much for supporting our troops  And the incident where Baxter International tried to start an avian flu pandemic with spiked flu vaccine has gone totally unreported and unpunished; in fact the WHO subsequently contracted with Baxter to develop a swine flu vaccine  Baxter had patented such a vaccine MONTHS BEFORE the first outbreak in Mexico  This was either incredibly lucky timing or the most cynical mass injury since the 1918 flu pandemic where only the vaccinated people died

in response to autismdemystified; get your facts straight  Pediatric flu vaccines have no thimerisol no any mercury containing compounds  Not for many years now  And the rate of autism supposedly is UP  likely better diagnostic ability in clinical staff  I'm not saying there is no definate link  Get off the anti-immunization band wagon  How many children have to die from preventable diseases as we all loose herd immunity because of scare tactics like you spread  be careful for what you sow you shall reap  The REGULAR flu kills many many healthy children each year  What about them?

1madmd1 Do you have any proof that there's no thimerosal in pediatric vaccines? According to the CDC the majority of flu vaccines contain thimerosal  The FDA lists vaccines as preservative-free if they don't contain enough thimerosal to act as a preservative  In other words your vaccine could very well have thimerosal in it but your governemnt isn't telling you about it  Besides what is it about the government or the pharmaceuticals that make you think you can trust them?

If 99 percent of children get their shots and 1 percent don't and never get any diseases it only means that 99 percent are protected therefore the other 1 percent don't come into contact with someone who has a disease  I have 2 children they've had all their shots and are fine  I would be devastated if one of my children were affected by their vaccines so I don't claim to know what that is like but it doesn't mean they don't save millions of lives and we should end their use

Butylated Hydroxytoluene (BHT) as an adjuvant/prophylactic for influenza The food preservative Butylated Hydroxytoluene (BHT) is reported to be an immune system booster with regard to lipid (fatty) coated viruses including those for influenza  [Caution! BHT is not considered to be a health aid other than for its role as a food preservative ] It is however a powerful antioxidant and can be said to behave like a beefed up version of Vitamin C or E  One version (there are at least three) of what BHT does with regard to lipid coated viruses centers on the idea that viral lipid coats serve as cloaking devices which prevent your immune system from seeing what's inside them  BHT as a powerful antioxidant is thought to strip the fatty coats off viral bodies or damage them enough so that your immune system can see the bad stuff and take it out  BHT is inexpensive and typically comes as a white crystaline powder in 250 mg capsules  (You most likely will have to order it online ) BHT is soluble in animal fat and alcohol (not water)  One European investigator who studied the effect of BHT on animals found that 27 mg per 100 pounds of body weight is a safe amount to ingest daily  Many people use 250 mg per day and more  Caution it is also a blood thinner  If you are on blood thinners including asprin you might want to take it the easy side with BHT

this morning 4000 students are not being admitted to Anchorage public schools because they lack manditory varicella vaccination  This is the chicken pox vaccine a vaccine which imparts a passve immunity to children for approx  5-6 years requiring two lifetime booster shots  if the first shot is administered at age 6 then booster shots will follow at ages 11-12 and 15-18  this is the end of the series  at approx  age 20 -24 the subject will have lost their passive immunity and probably have no primary immunity leaving them vulnerable to what is now a very dangerous primnary adult infection of chicken pox  when adults with no immunity get chicken pox for the first time it is very dangerous often deadly as compared to what is a mostly harmless diease with children who must suffer two weeks of being itchy  in adults chicken pox has neurological repurcussions and is often responsible for organ failure  To those who immunize their children make an informed decision and research this on your own  ask your medical doctor if his own children are immunized the answer may surprise you  What i believe i see here is big pharma manufacturing a future health care emergency a plauge of adult onset chicken pox which will disasterous repurcussions for the population and huge finbacial rewards for big pharma  don't enter your kids in the population control lottery  let the ignorant do it they'll be missed less

    The mother of our granddaughter received the H1N1 vaccination about three weeks before our granddaughter was born  Immediately after birth medical staff were concerned about the condition of the baby  Now after four months and many tests and hospital stays a neurologist has found from an MRI that the baby's brain and brain stem are smaller than they should be  There is also more fluid around the brain than there should be  Therefore doctors say to expect slow and limited development  The very interesting point is that the neorologist says he feels that what ever caused the unusual brain development happened late in the pregnancy!

You CAN'T get the flu from the vaccine

    Just so you are aware you CANNOT get the flu from the flu SHOT  The viral component of the vaccine is only pieces of the virus and as such it is a DEAD virus therefore you cannot get the flu  If you have flu-like symptoms you may have already been exposed to the virus before the vaccine took effect in your immune system (typically 2 weeks to take effect) OR most reactions after receiving a vaccination are fever muscle and joint soreness achy lethargy and some pain at the site  If you have those symptoms just take some Tylenol drink some extra fluids and get some rest  Don't blame the vaccine! When you get vaccinated you are not only protecting yourself or your children  You are protecting an infinite number of people around you or who could potentially come into contact with you when you could be carrying and transmitting a virus without even knowing you've been infected (not showing symptoms YET or never showing symptoms!) Take care of yourself AND OTHERS  Be well

I've had mine!

    I had my swine flu jab my arm was really painful the 1st night but I've had it pretty easy after I've heard of some of the complaints people have had  Fingers crossed all will be well

Vitamin D

    Vitamin D is also a great way to protect against the flu  We can get it from sunlight 
—Guest Joanne

Get all the information

    In Canada there is less mercury in the H1N1 flu shot than there is in a tuna fish sandwich  Yes we're told to reduce mercury intake but make sure the amount you're avoiding in the shot is actually an amount that is a concern  Check to see how much mercury is in the shot available in the US before you freak out and avoid a shot that could save your life or your baby's life  
—Guest Laura

Not Fun

    As someone who contracted H1N1 during her third trimester I would highly recommend pregnant women do anything possible to protect themselves from this flu  Whether you get a flu shot or choose to protect yourself in another way (I've read that salt-water gargling and nasal cleansing can be effective)  I was completely bed-ridden exhausted and in extreme discomfort for several days even after beginning a treatment of tamiflu  7 days later and I'm still tired and sore  Several of my acquaintances have found themselves in the hospital with pneumonia and breathing difficulty  If you do find yourself with symptoms see your dr  rightaway because tamiflu is only affective if begun within the first 48 hours of symptoms

vaccines

    The H1N1 vaccine is no different than the seasonal flu vaacine which has been given for the last 20+ years with the exception of the viruse that it is meant to protect us from  So we have had years of its use and proven safety  If they virus mutates then potentially it will not be as effective but hopefully it will still impart some immunity so we will fair better if infected  
—Guest cec

Leaning towards NO

    My gut tells me not to get this shot  I have heard that doctors say to get it because of the high risk of pregnant woman who are more likely to pass because of complications   but then I read that others doctors tell them not to worry if they do not want to take the H1N1 vaccine  All I know is that it is new unproven and I am only 10 weeks  I have always gotten the flu after getting the regular flu shot and do not get the flu when I do not get the shot  I am thinking the same might happen with this one! I will keep hands clean cover my mouth and rest as much as I can  That will keep me safer I think 
—Guest Sheri

Not taking vaccine

    Confused worried I am not planning to taking flu or swine flu shots  Planning to avoid sick people and crowd  
—Guest Raji

No for me

    My obstetrician has told me not to have the vaccination as there is no thorough testing and no way of knowing if the vaccination will cause harm or illness  I just don't want to risk it so I'm saying no for now 
—Guest Jacqui

Still Undecided

    I haven't decided what to do about both flu vaccines  I've never had a flu shot so I'm kind of weary about it although I know it's important and crucial right now  I think the H1N1 vaccine is still too new and we don't know enough about it to know the outcome  I only work one on one with my clients and have a very easy job  I most likely will get the flu shot but not the H1N1 shot  I plan to just stay away from high risk areas and I'm especially careful when I go out in public  I always carry hand sanitizer with me and use it after touching door handles shopping carts etc  I've also become more aware of not touching my eyes nose or mouth without washing my hands  I'm just taking extra precaution and pray I don't get sick

swine flu vaccine

    The swine flu vaccine is new and usually it takes years for a vaccine to be proven safe  Many side effects are not known and I am afraid to take it  The regular flu vaccine is not really reducing the risk for flu  Many of the people I know got the flu after vaccination 
—Guest manuela

Concerned

    I am leaning towards not getting the vaccine unless I can find one that is made without the mercury  Both of my children have severe egg allergies and I fear what it will do to my unborn baby   I just do no know!
—Guest Amy

Thimerosal and Vaccines

    In response to bek this is directly from the CDC website: Is it safe for pregnant women to receive an influenza vaccine that contains thimerosal? Yes  A study of influenza vaccination examining over 2000 pregnant women demonstrated no adverse fetal effects associated with influenza vaccine  Case reports and limited studies indicate that pregnancy can increase the risk for serious medical complications of influenza  One study found that out of every 10000 women in their third trimester of pregnancy during an average flu season 25 will be hospitalized for flu related complications  Additionally influenza-associated excess deaths among pregnant women have been documented during influenza pandemics  Because pregnant women are at increased risk for influenza-related complications and because a substantial safety margin has been incorporated into the health guidance values for organic mercury exposure the benefits of influenza vaccine with reduced or standard thimerosal content   
—BethP781

Fetal complications from Flu

    The flu regular flu or S1N1 can lead to very serious problems in the fetus even if the mother gets over it with little issue  Babies can suffer brain trama mental retardation and cerebral palsy among other things from an infection in the womb or from the flu where the mother's immune system goes into overdrive and actually starts attacking the fetal cells  As for the flu shot do you KNOW? It contains thermasil  The children's vaccines have been getting the hype but the regular seasonal flu shots have always contained thermasil  If you are pregnant ASK FOR THE THERMASIL FREE SHOT!!!! This includes the S1N1 flu shot  They are harder to come by but worth it  Pass it on to your pregnant friends  Get educated about thermasil in flu shots  There are options  I get the flu shots for myself and my family but only the thermasil/mercury free ones  They are now recommending 2 flu shots for the h1n1 flu  Good luck!
—Guest apstarlet

No Vaccine for Me

    Some of the H1N1 vaccines contain Thimerosal (mercury) which HAS BEEN PROVEN to cause damage to developing babies' brains  Why would they discourage eating fish and risk exposure to lower levels of mercury but push this drug which has not yet been tested? I will take all the precautions I can to stay healthy in my 3rd trimester but I will not be taking the vaccine 
—Guest bek

Home birth & Vaccinations!

    Though I do think I'll get the regular flu shot at my next prenatal appointment I'm still debating the swine flu shot  I was on the fence before about having a home birth but the thought of a hospital filled with illness made me realize babies shouldn't be born there if they don't need to be  I've worked hard to stay low risk  My midwife and my doctor agree home birth is a safe option for me  If I need to go to the hospital my doctor said she'd let me leave as soon as I was able so that I would be exposed to fewer germs  
—Guest Sassy Pants

Confused!

    There is so much info out there and it can be confusing  Talk to your doctor about what is best for you which might be different than the general guidelines  I can't take the vaccination so my family practitioner is helping me learn how to stay safe without the vaccine  She's also calming my fears by explaining the reality without the hysteria  Though she did remind me that a hospital is a germy place  She too said that I should plan on keeping the baby in my room the entire time  She's going to visit baby there for exams  Her office also gave me a brochure on breastfeeding as protection from the flu and other illness 
—Guest Momee2B

Washing Hands More Often

    Mostly my flu prevention strategy is to stay away from people who I know are ill and washing my hands more frequently than usual  Other than that I am trying to stay away from the hysteria 
—maelli3

Undecided

    I'm not sure about the vaccine but my doctor and I discussed a plan in case I'm sick  So I know what to look for and when to call  The hospital I'm at is doing away with the nursery and requesting everyone room in to avoid babies getting infected

about.com,317,###,"(1) pregnancy says:

    Taking medications is a decision between a woman and her practitioner  Since there is known risk involved it would be wrong for pregnant women to indiscriminately be given the medications prior to testing to ensure what they had was swine flu that they were in the right treatment window and that they were fully informed of the risks associated with taking these medications

    Newborns have very immature immune systems and are especially at risk for catching a virus or bacterial infection  What should I do if there are people with swine flu in the hospital when I go into labor? I’ve heard of some people thinking of finding a home birth midwife and changing plans …

(3) pregnancy says:

    There is a call for more midwives by many organizations  You can read about some of the info at Our Bodies Our Blog  There are women who choose midwives and homebirth for all sorts of reasons  The biggest issue is that even if a woman would like to have a midwife and/or a homebirth she may not have adequate access or coverage

    I was already planning a home birth with a midwife in order to keep my newborn safe from the various infectious diseases floating around the hospital – not to mention all of the other risks to laboring mothers and newborns from unnecessary medical interventions in birth  This outbreak just confirms the sensibility of this decision  Hospitals are for sick people not healthy women giving birth to healthy babies

(8) Monica says:

    Hospitals are for pregnant woman to give birth  I’d rather be in a hospital than at home in case any complications arise  The risk of catching this flu is low if you use standard precautionary measures: wash your hands every hour use hand sanitizers don’t touch your face 
    My concern is that if I do catch the swine flu I won’t be able to take meds  Also if the WHO raises their level up to a 6 being a full pandemic I hope work will let me stay at home considering that I can’t take any meds!

    This article fails to mention anything about the potential outcomes if you are pregnant and have influenza  I am 7 weeks pregnant and I have been hit hard by seasonal flu  The potential risk to the foetus of influenza and the accompanying hyperthermia is double the risk of neural tube defects  I had to find that at the CDC…  my practitioner had no clue  So yay for me

I guess I am trying to figure out if I should just wait

(21) Hannah says:

    I’m 10 weeks pregnant and think you all sound a little too paranoid! Its good to be cautious and wash your hands etc but its not healthy for you OR your baby to worry so obsessively and hide yourself away throughout your pregnancy!!! You’ve probably got more chance of being in a car accident or falling down the stairs and hurting your baby than getting swine flu and harming your baby! And if you do get Swine flu you can take Renefil (I think that’s what its called the other one from Tamiflu) as it is inhaled and does not cross to the baby  The important thing is to have a happy and calm pregnancy and enjoy it!!! Your stress hormones or happy hormones are passed onto your baby!!! If something happens THEN you deal with it but don’t spend the next few months worried sick about any little thing that could go wrong! Most likely it won’t!

    I have had the swine flu when i was almost 29 weeks  I got it while staying at the hospital on bed rest  They gave me relenza and then arithromycin in case of secondary bacteria  When I was 14 weeks pregnant i got sick but much worse so i’m thinking maybe it was seasonal flu that is why my body fought this swine flu much better  It has been the second time i took arithromycin (first at 14 weeks) and doctors reassured me it is better to take pills then deal with complications the virus might cause

    I think worrying ourselves sick is worse than getting the flu looking after our bodies and baby is what we should be worrying about not stressing about something that hasn’t happened  Alot worse things can happen during pregnancy and to our general health  Swine flu isn’t as bad a seasonal flu anyway

    Hi everyone! Like you all I am 12 weeks pregnant  I just saw on the telly this morning that Swine Flu is very risky for pregnant women especially in the 2nd and third trimesters  I have to admit that I am very worried  Especially because the words “pregnant women” “swine flu” and “fighting for their lives” were all included in the one story  After reading all the previous comments from all of you I have to say that I am feeling a lot better about this than 10 minutes ago  I have had Influenza A before unlucky but lucky because now I know what the symptoms are and will know when to get to the doctors 
    Hope all goes well for every expectant mother reading this page  Stay healthy and happy as we all know that’s the best thing for your babies

I am getting so worked up about going  In my normal job I can avoid people but I feel like I am jumping into a sea of sharks by going  Am I being over dramatic and just get on with it or should I put my foot down and not go? What would you do?

    Hi Kelly you say you have contracted it in the hospital  That is very frightening  I am curious if that was in a maternity unit? 
    I am 39 weeks pregnant and can go into labour anytime  However I am worried about hospital policies in such cases and their cleaning standards  Also the staff has a higher risk of contracting it from other people and therefore passing onto us during labour  I am petrified 
    Hope you get better soon

    I’ve just hit the three month mark I had swine flu a couple of weeks ago and both me and the baby are fine  I wanted to post to reassure those of you who have been left scared by all the government confusion and media hype 

    For me it was a very mild illness  I did have a temperature but it was slight  The soar throat/ cough isn’t fun but compared to a flu I caught last Christmas it was really minor  I spent a day in bed a day in front of the TV and then I was up and about around the house 

    First I spoke to an out-of-hours doctor who I admit was a bit rubbish and didn’t give me any advice  But then I spoke to my GP who was excellent  She told me to watch my temperature get in contact if symptoms got worse and having discussed it we decided together that I shouldn’t take anything just yet as personally I prefer not to take any unnecessary medication 

    I know flu hits different people in different ways but I think I’m likely to be fairly average  I don’t have any additional health problems but nor am I any kind of health nut; I’m just a normal mum-to-be  With paracetamol and lots of fluids my temperature never got to dangerous levels  I really do want to reassure others that as long as you look after yourself (or get your bloke to look after you!) if you’re anything like me it’s likely to be a very mild illness  I have lots of friends who had much worse flu than the version I got while they were pregnant and their babies are beautiful healthy and full of handy antibodies

    Get a new midwife – seriously  I wouldn’t let her near my baby  Now I too am worried about swine flu  I work in a convenience store and that money is handled by hundreds maybe thousands of people before me  I just gotta keep my hands washed and go about my life  If I get it I will do everything in my power to get rid of it as fast as possible  What scares me even more is that they want to practically test this vaccine on pregnant women who are carrying the next generation of children on earth! I mean I may not get the vaccine and just try to stay in as good as health as I can  I don’t want to be a guinea pig

I read that breast feeding is supposed to keep the baby from being sick but still worried about that  I hope that I just get better quickly!

I was just wondering what the general consensus is: Should pregnant women risk taking the “Swine Flu” vaccine and all the unknown side affects that may come with it or wait it out and do everything possible not to get it and then go from there? What’s the appropriate approach?

    I’m 34 weeks preggo and just got over the swine flu…Tamiflu and Relenza only work in the first 48 hours of the sickness so I never took any…just continued with my OTC pregnancy approved meds  OBGYN told me that the baby will be born with some immunity to the flu now so that made me feel a little better!

    Hi! I’m 25 weeks pregnant and I’m scared that I might catch the H1N1  For the last 2 days I had some cough slight headaches body aches tiredness burning eyes and I feel like I’m about to get a fever  I’m thinking it might just be a good but still concerned  A lot of people from where I’m from had already gotten it and as far as I know 3 or 4 people lost their lives  It makes me scared because its a small town and i heard pregnant people are at higher risk

    Hello girls!!! I’m 24 and 17 weeks pregnant with my first baby and I’M TERRIFIED THAT I WILL GET H1N1  I am a Director of Nursing at a women’s prison and im inundated with information about H1N1 which makes me even more crazy! I most scared becasue I fall into three of the high risk categories  I can’t decide if I should get the vaccine  What does everybody think? It’s so new and it scares me I think being a nurse is bad becasue I just know too much for my own good!! HELP!! We will all get through this…I hope! good luck to all of you!!

    I am 17 weeks pregnant and I’m not getting the vaccine  I have friends in the military who have had the shot vaccine…and the nasal spray…as they are overseas and a few of them have come down with swine flu from the shot which they say isnt a live virus in the shot  Another close friend of mine who is pregnant just got a regular flu shot  and a few days later she came down with swine flu…I’m not doing it 

    The pregnant women who have died from swine flu…didnt seek treatment until 6 or so days after they got the first few symptoms  I’ve spent numerous and countless hours reasearching…

    You ladies who choose not to get it…will be fine  just take care of your self and go to the doctor asap if you have symptoms

    I think it is irresponsible for you to say “You ladies who choose not to get it…will be fine  ”

    What gives you special knowledge of the future for people you don’t know?

    Talking about your decisions for yourself even if they are based on sketchy anecdotal evidence is one thing but giving medical advice is another 

    As someone who knows first hand that medical catastrophes can happen to even the most careful people I will definitely get the vaccination but I still wouldn’t tell people that they “will be fine” if they do what I do

    It’s so reassuring to read about the experiences of pregnant women on this site who have had H1N1 and have recovered from it  My doctor is pushing the flu vaccines (both seasonal flu and swine flu) on me but I can’t in good conscience inject my body with potentially harmful chemicals  Yes I do lean toward natural medicine in general  However I feel that my doctors cannot assuage my fears about additives in the vaccine such as squalene and thimerasol  I am a teacher and I work with 90-120 elementary school children every day  They are constantly sneezing in my face or picking their noses  We all wash our hands frequently but I don’t know if that’s enough to keep us all healthy  I’m 17 weeks pregnant now and I’m still unsure about the swine flu vaccine  I have already decided not to get the seasonal flu shot  I think I am going to take my chances and do my best to get enough rest and take care of myself including calling my doctor the minute I suspect that I’m experiencing flu symptoms  Good luck to all of you out there who are wrestling with this same issue!

    Here in France we are as puzzled as you probably are in the UK whether to get this vaccine or not  They suddenly stopped talking about the spread of the virus in the news  They just mention it whenever a death occurs  Some scientists were invited on tv but they always contradicted themselves  I am lost and find it hard to take a decision for my kids and myself  I am 21 weeks pregnant my kids are 4 and 2 and at school  It is rather impossible to break the virus with kids  They always kiss hug play together even though they often wash their hands  Then I cannot prevent myself from cuddling my kids either  I am scared but still not convinced what to do  I never thought about getting a jab for another flu so why this one in particular?

    Thank you for all of your posts  I am 9 weeks pregnant and I too have been overwhlemed with the hype and bad news regarding the high risk for pregnant women  We find out we are pregnant and we just want to enjoy our pregnancy  I am in the US and have a 9 year old that has friends in his class who have been sick with H1N1  They are all back and doing okay  I also have coworkers out with th flu as well  I have made the decision to get the 1 shot “non preservative” vaccine (when available)  I was completely against the vaccine given that they tell us to stay away from certain foods and now I need to get this shot?! After long hours of praying and doing research with my family I was told that they make the 1 shot vaccine without mercury  That reassured me and I decided to get it since I dont want to go through the holidays worrying  Plenty of women get the seasonal flu shot and their babies are fine  This one is made the same way “as I have been told and researched”  If you do choose to get one ask for the “non preservative” one  Thank you all for giving us your positive feedback on recovering from the flu  I really need too hear those stories more often  We all need to relax focus on our bodies and our babies  I was very sick with the flu when I had my son (at 37 weeks)  I made it through and he is very healthy  Enjoy your families and take care of yourselves

    Well I am 38 weeks pregnant  I received the Tamflu shot at my OB-GYN’s request about a momth ago 

    They are offering free vaccinations against H1N1 this wednesday for the 1st 300 pregant women who show up at the health department clinic  I am not wanting to go still haven’t decided  My concern is: what if I give birth and a nurse/other newborns have H1N1 in the hospital? Would my newborn be better protected if I do get the shot or not?

    On the other side I am not crazy about having anything injected into me especially with the baby so close to delivery  My husband really wants me to get it but I am still on the fence 

    I do believe people are freaking out excessively  Thousands die from the flu every year  Also has anyone given thought to the fact that we are such a germaphobic nation now that are immune systems are now weakened because we’ve over- sanitized ourselves to death… literally??

    To get it or not to get it… that is the question 

    I’m 12 weeks pregnant and was concerned about getting the h1n1 shot  I’ve done a lot of research and I’ve decided to get both flu shots 

    What helped me decide? Medical experts get together each year to see which viruses to include in the seasonal flu shot  Swine flu came about after the season flu shot was finalized  Therefore a second shot was prepared because they could not make it in time to include it in the regular seasonal shot 

    I don’t know about the rest of you but I can take peace in knowing I’m actively doing everything I can to protect me and my unborn baby  That is why I am getting both flu shots  I don’t know if i could forgive myself if something dreadful happened all because i was skeptical about a shot recommended by the CDC health experts and my doctor

    And another thing I’ve heard people say that they “rushed” the process that they hurried the h1n1 vaccine so it was done carelessly  They used the same exact procedure and I’ll tell you what…I do my very best work when under a tight deadline  High pressure deadlines make me focus on nothing but the job at hand  I think errors are more often made when you have plenty of time to let your mind wonder off in space  That’s just my two cents anyway

(61) pregnant with swine flu says:

    I am 12 weeks pregnant and have been diagnosed with swine flu this week  I started Tamiflu which is the recommended course of treatment for pregnant women with flu  The benefits of being treated with Tamiflu (decreases viral replication shortens symptom period) in pregnancy OUTWEIGHS the risk of complicated cases of flu by not undergoing treatment  Especially if you have underlying health problems  Tamiflu is most effective within the first 48 hours of symptom onset  In pregnancy you must keep hydrated with plenty of fluids and if unable to keep them down you should go to the ER for intravenous (IV) fluid hydration  Dehydration puts the pregnant woman at risk for uterine contraction which could ultimately lead to premature labor or miscarriage if you are early in pregnancy  Controlling fever is very important–only use acetaminophen/Tylenol…no aspirin aleve or advil in pregnancy  Hyperthermia in the pregnant mother can increase risks of neural tube defects  Finally please get vaccinated for both influenza and H1N1 this fall if you are pregnant you may receive the vaccines in any trimester  Get plenty of rest drink fluids and keep your distance from other at home–sleep in separate rooms from your partner until you recover  Also use a separate hand towl in the bathroom and replace your toothbrush once your symptoms resolve  Take care and good luck

Why not separate and pump the milk? Influenza does not pass through milk but most certainly does pass through droplet in a 10 foot radius

When my 2nd daughter was born my husband had contracted influenza (not H1N1--this was almost 6 years ago--it was obviously a different influenza strain but I don't remember which one) probably through work (he's an RN)  It led to the death of several residents at his work  I then contracted it with my newborn at home and my 1st daughter also got it  The only one that didn't get influenza was my newborn  I was told by the pediatrician that it was probably because she was breastfed and also 10 pounds at birth  (Of course separation was not an option I developed the flu when I arrived home ) Rah rah breastmilk!

That is true  Thus the precautions listed 

Why not separate and pump?

1  Babies need to be with their mothers and vice versa  This is especially true in the early newborn stage 
2  A sick mother isn't likely to have the energy or desire to pump milk because it's a time consuming and draining process  It would be easier for the mother to rest and breastfeed directly  Also there would be less risk of incidental conatimination (assuming the mother is following precautions including wearing a mask) with direct breastfeeding  Especially with an illness as serious as the flu can be breastfeeding should continue so that the infant benefits from the immune factors that breastmilk provides 

The bottom line is separation stresses both baby and mother and threatens the breastfeeding relationship (which can have far reaching consequences)  Separation is unnecessary because reasonable precautions can be taken in order to prevent infection ",,,,,,,$$$

I don't believe that getting vaccinations means protecting our babies as much as we can   nursing our babies is protecting them as much as we can    I have been doing reserch about breastfeeding and it is miraculous! Let's say my son is crawling on the ground and picks up H1N1 he then sends that virus into my body through my breast and my body ON THE SPOT creates the 'antibiotic' for that virus the same goes with germs or just illness   it is like he places the order and my body makes up what he needs that exact moment to make him healthy again and survive!! ladies we can heal our babies and keep them healthy and strong it is the way we were made! cool hey! This has happened for my son with ear infections I had the doctors give him medication but I didn't give it to him he nursed more often and bam all of a sudden he was back to health and has the resistence now for it next time  I believe there is obviously a time and place for antibiotics and vaccinations BUT I also believe that we forget about what has always been there to keep our babies alive and striving     our milk   it is miraculous do some research about it:)

I think that this whole H1N1 thing is a flu!! No biggy   the doc said I had it and my son we had a harsh fever I just nursed him more and took tons of vitamins relaxed slept had a lot of rest and our bodies fought it!! People with strong immune systems shouldn't be worried about this H1N1 shot  We just need to keep our bodies healthy and wash our hands and nurse our babies   then there is nothing to be scared about

The adjuvanted vaccine package insert plainly states the product was associated with birth defects developmental delays in offspring and miscarriages I can't believe the Canadian government would allow ANY pregnant woman to get this shot! I don't know about the unadjuvanted shot but Thimerosal has been shown to cause neurological damage in mice (Hornig 2004) and developmental delays in newborn monkeys (Hewitson2009)  As someone who is trying to get pregnant there is no way I would take either shot  What if I accidentally take it shortly before conceiving or soon after? Data from the Australian swine flu season showed pregnant women were NOT at more risk of complications but obese women were  The pregnant women in the ICU were obese  And the flu shot has never been proven to reduce hospitalizations or deaths in pregnant women- or kids for that mater  No way will my son and I get vaccinated

Everything that I have read indicates pregnant women should only have the vaccination after 16 weeks   does anyone know why and can it pose a risk if you get it earlier? I am 11 weeks along and I am a teacher  Given my constant contact with sick kids (including my 3 year old son) I would like to know if others are getting their before 16 weeks too

I'm glad to hear that the vaccine shouldn't affect pregnancy  My husband and I decided that the entire household (including my 22 month old son) should have the shot since we are both teachers and interact with students who have been showing up after being exposed to classmates attending class with the H1N1  Of course now that we've had our shots I suddenly realized that I might be expecting     about 5 or 6 weeks!

I agree I was completely skepticle about getting it and who knows if there will be any long term side effects to the vaccine  I honestly would rather stay in my house for the next 4 months then put something in my system that isnt tried tested and true maybe if it has been around for years I would consider it but its new and I dont want to take any chances I lost one pregnancy and I am not willing to lose another

I have asthma and I had to wait for months to get the H1N1 vaccine because I wasn't in the right age/risk group  I kept contacting my doctor's office and saying But I have ASTHMA! And they kept replying I couldn't have it by law  I was able to get a seasonal vaccine in November through the City of Boston's free clinics  (My doctor ran out of her supply ) I already KNOW as all my fellow sufferers do that asthma puts me at risk for serious complications from the flu whenever I catch the flu I am very ill 

So I was finally allowed to get the H1N1 shot at my doctor's office on Monday  So now in 3 LONG weeks I'll be immune in theory  And NOW they're saying we asthmatics belong at the front of the line! Thanks for figuring that out this late in the flu season! I did everything I could to try to get the vaccine earlier but it was impossible

It is possible that some of the increase in asthma diagnosis is due to improved diagnosis also  I had the winter cold asthma and infection symptoms chronically as a child in the 1950s-1960s  I was not diagnosed until I was 35 and referred myself to an allergist and I had pretty conscientious medical care and a health plan all along 

There is much more awareness now that may account for some of the statistics  I routinely get the flu shots and anything else that is available such as pneumonia shots and so on  Kids today have it great that their allergies and asthma do not have to interfere with living a normal life 

i had the same experience as Ms-Demeanor above in trying to get an H1N1 shot and only got one a couple of weeks ago when it was released to the general population  My husband who is an ex-smoker and has some lung damage from an old untreated childhood infection also has an autoimmune disease and he didn't get the H1N1 shot until the general release either 

It doesn't matter what the causes are (we can figure that out later)  Right now we need to take care of people  If the immunizations cause a reaction of course you shouldn't do it but for most people with any of these conditions we need to be immunized for ourselves and to get herd immunity to protect everyone else

on a side note   I also know lots of people that have had the H1N1 and it was more mild than the flu for them  I know people who have had the shot and still got the flu  My five year old is an asthmatic and I did have him vaccinated for the H1N1 but it was not an easy decision for me  Good luck and stay healthy!

What the publc doesn't know is that there are many variants of the H1N1 flu therefore the vaccine may only protect against a few  So yes it's possible to still get sick after getting the shot

I share Ms  Demeanor's frustration  I am 51 and have asthma which has been horrible this year (have had it my whole life)  My doctor's office (Harvard Vanguard!) ran out of the regular flu shot so I got that at work  I kept checking the Vanguard site for H1N1 and they said they'd write me when they had it  My city (Newton) said I was at the rock bottom priority so couldn't get it at one of the flu clinics here  I finally got my H1N1 today while on a work assignment at Neponset Community Health Center (yeah Boston Public Health Commission!)  If I do get H1N1 from what folks are saying above I am definitely Beth Israel bound 

There are many theories as to why asthma is more prevalent now  These include increased mold spores within households increased carbon monoxide in the air etc  Prevalence varies across the state  Higher rates of asthma are concentrated in the urban areas with a surprisingly high rate in the Springfield area  Check www mass gov/dph  The increased rate is not made up by the pharmaceutical companies it is real

It's true    vaccine makers are reaping huge profits from vaccines  billions in fact  Vaccines are considered one of the fastest growing sectors of the Pharmaceutical industry  As early as 2007 financial advisors started telling investors to buy stock in flu vaccine in the event of a flu pandemic    two years before the H1N1 flu outbreak 

Here's a sampling of market reports about vaccines:


Vaccines and Their Promise Are Roaring Back - NYT article

But in a stunning reversal innovators today are chasing dozens of vaccines stimulated by some recent high-profile successes  ''People see vaccines as money makers'' says Paul A  Offit chief of the infectious diseases section at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and the author of ''Vaccinated'' a new book on Hilleman's career 

As wealthy countries spend much more on health care and as poorer countries put new emphasis on disease prevention many companies are jumping into vaccine innovation including major pharmaceutical makers like Astra Zeneca Novartis and Pfizer  Two separate teams one involving Dr  Offit at GlaxoSmithKline and the other at Merck created in recent years rotavirus vaccines for childhood diarrhea a big killer in less developed countries 


Global Vaccine Market To Top 23 Billion Dollars

$23 8 billion by 2012 - something else to say Ouch about 
by Steve Mitchell- UPI Senior Medical Correspondent

The global vaccine market is expected to top $10 billion this year and $23 8 billion by 2012 according to an analyst report released Friday  Pediatric vaccines have historically dominated this field but adult vaccines will see a big spike due to increased uptake of influenza and hepatitis vaccines predicts a report from Kalorama Information  Cancer vaccines will also become a major player in the vaccine market rising from its current level of $135 million to more than $8 billion by 2012 


Global Vaccine Market Forecast to 2012- Marketwatch

Vaccines have emerged as one of the most lucrative segment in the global pharmaceutical industry  With a projected CAGR of over 13% during 2009-2012 the industry will emerge as the fastest growing therapy area  The US and Europe represent the two largest vaccine markets in the world and will continue experiencing healthy growth rate in future

Global Vaccine Market To Top 23 Billion Dollars

$23 8 billion by 2012 - something else to say Ouch about 
by Steve Mitchell UPI Senior Medical Correspondent
Washington (UPI) Feb 08 2007

(an excerpt from above article)

When you're talking about the overall vaccine market I think the big interest is in influenza vaccines HIV vaccines and cancer vaccines said Aaron Woolsey an analyst with Decision Resources 

The biggest growth in the flu-vaccine market will come in the area of vaccines for pandemics that could be caused by the H5N1 strain of bird flu 

With avian flu the interest in flu vaccine has picked up Woolsey said 

A number of companies are developing vaccines against the H5N1 strain including GSK Sanofi Novartis and Baxter 

For the regular annual flu vaccine some companies are working on developing a multivalent vaccine that might protect individuals against five or six variants of flu strains rather than the three offered by current vaccines Woolsey said  But the main thrust right now is in developing vaccines to protect against a flu pandemic

Questioning the science or the vaccines for that matter does not neccessarily make someone anti-science or anti-vaccine  It does however open ones eyes though 

Vaccines are not the golden calf the Pharmaceutical companies make them out to be that can be attributed to good marketing  In fact many people have been injured by the vaccines though you'll rarely hear victims stories in the mainstream 

Read the CDC's VAERS reports of which there are thousands  You'll find the truth is often surpressed and woe be unto anyone who publically criticizes the vaccine industry or the questions the science  They will pay professionally and their reputations will be destroyed (ex: Andrew Wakefield)  These are very powerful entities who can be quite ruthless  They have a lot invested in this product and it's more about keeping the dollars flowing than keeping anyone of us well  You can bet on that

calgary.ctv.ca,150,###,"Nonsense!!
Come on AHS who is going to help us on the frontline when they themselves get sick just not fair to these special professionals? All these health and emergency personel should have had there vaccines by now along with the All the children pregnant women and children and all High Risk citizens  Makes no sense   complete nonsense that they have not also been given priority for the vaccine  My heart of appreciation goes out to all our healthcare worker EMS and police for all the care and service they are giving us Albertans and risking themselves to get sick  They are our heroes and have risky jobs that should be honored and acknowledged and they should be taken care of!! You know you are getting large amount of vaccine next week so get it organized now to have clinic for our healthcare worker EMS and police  Go to the schools close schools for a couple days for vaccination then parents can take their children and get vaccinated themselves if they want and no excuse from AHS that need a consent form  The children at schools are suffering with alot of children who are sick  AHS do you read or listen to any of us???

Dave from Calgary
I'm a Calgary Police Officer and I've already missed a week of work to H1N1  For me the vaccine will come too late but the sooner the better for all the other frontline Cops Firefighters and EMS  The city needs and wants as many of us at work as possible all the time because it makes the city a safer place to live  There's a lot of things to be concerned about out there besides just flu bugs  You've got men and women who are more than willing to go to work everyday and put ourselves in harms way to protect you but it's tough to do with this flu  A flu vaccination a week or two ago would have been nice then I'd be at work right now 

upset flames fan
the city should concider talking to Ken King and seeing if he can pull the same strings for the men and women in Blue

TLC
They should have along with EMS and hospital staff been the FIRST ones to get this shot especially if they are also in the high-risk category 

Willyboy
In the meantine best bet would be to call a Flame  They'll all be healthy 
But wait who would play hockey then?
Gosh what are my priorities anyway   

Volunteer Firefighter
I hope the city think of the hundreds of volunteer firefighter around the city  We are in just as much risk of getting H1N1 as any other firefighter in the city  Call numbers may be different however it only takes one sick patent to pass it on to the firefighter helping them 

Kathleen
This fiasco certainly shows where priorities lie  I wonder if the Flames will be available to drive ambulances and put out fires???? Somehow I doubt it 

Jean
I hope the Police and firemen and all front line people get the H1N1
asap   Thurday is too late It should of been done last week    we could be in great need in a couple of weeks with all the Police off sick 
AHS get with it!!!!

Lois
I just don't understand    not very long ago the city was desperate to add to the frontline support  Now when we have finally been able to add some of these professionals we are willing to risk their health (and possibly their lives)? It makes no sense - if they get sick who will deal with our upsurge of crime and emergencies  Vaccinate these people - please - we need them!!

Rick
If these people really need the H1N1 shot maybe they should get part time jobs with the Flames  Oh yes heard the Flames management got the shots as well and their families? More people should be fired but Ed has no backbone for that what about the health minister?

Roy
The police and firefighters should stop whinningand purchase flames uniforms just call King I'm sure he can set something up for themit apears King and the flames players still have not figured they have done anything wrong

Si
I've been around lots of sick people in my job - yet I have not had so much as a runny nose 

Why? Because I take 5000 IU of vitamin D daily  I'm a life-long asthmatic and since I have been taking vitamin D3 (over 9 months now) I've not needed a single inhaler either 

Why take chances with a unproven vaccine when you can boost your immune system safely  Before I started taking D3 I was sick 3 or 4 times a year -- flu colds etc  And the seasonal flu vaccine NEVER worked for me 

I can't recommend vitamin D enough 

Al in Calgary
I think this should be asked first before the police and firefighters and whoever else  

When will the Nurses and support staff at the clinics be getting their shots?

They have families that can and do include high risk individuals but yet have not had their shots  
Even though they have been handling the mass crowds at these clinics that have had people with H1N1 reported at the clinics 



Brenda
OMG - just posted a comment about the Flames getting theirs - now feel stupid - police firefighters nurses doctors etc should get SPECIAL treatment!!!

G
no no no overpaid millionaires deserve the vaccine better

OF COURSE frontline workers deserve it  Fire police and health care workers 

Then the rest of the public 



UnknownBits
I still don't see AHSs logic in not offering the vaccine to these critical FRONT-LINE professionals who sometimes bring into hospital these cases 

Sure you folks at AHS fired the fool involved with the Flames screw-up but all of you need a slap upside the head for your total lack of understanding during the planning process  Are you folks really schooled in emergency response planning or is it that idiot who has seniority and nothing else?

Not a flames fan
Pretty sad when Flame get the shot before front line workers  Guess it all comes down to money 

shocked in Calgary
I'm shocked to know that Medical EMS Police and Fire Dept  personnel have not been vaccinated yet  They are in the front lines and could easily get infected and unknowingly spread the virus 

Every time I hear a negative comment about why my generation is so cynical here's proof 

WAKE UP! WAKE UP! WAKE UP!!!

Kat
Here is what I find odd my husband is an EMT and firefighter in the town of Olds 1 hour north of Calgary and all EMS and Firefigters were given the opportunity to have the H1N1 shot last friday and saturday at a special clinic just for them and other AHS personel here in Olds  I am glad they offered it for these workers but can't understand how it was not offered province wide for EMS 

Mr Doubtful
You people really need to settle down 
I agree that it is asinine giving this to pro sports teams before the public 
I know of a nurse in Manitoba who just got her shot two days ago 
A school in southern Manitoba had over 40 students and some staff members absent  Not one H1N1 confirmation 
There are a lot of people in this situation 
The truth is front line or back line if you are exposed you will get sick 

Sharon
Why can't we get our front-line workers to the FRONT OF THE LINE?!?!

Plan for a 'worst case scenario' can we afford to have 1/3 of our firefighters police and EMS workers all sick with the flu? I don't think so!

Jon
Hmmm    it's good to get the frontline people vaccinated however I think you forgot the Teachers who are working with the most high risk group (the children)

Seth
First responders that's fine with me  But what about the Roughnecks & Hitmen ????

angel
I thought all front line workers were to be first in line - EMSpolice firefighters doctors nurses etc   WOW is the government out to lunch or what!!!

Carol
All this bickering over a flu shot  Me first no I am more important than you are  Really sounds like schoolyard recess  Yes police and firefighters need to get vaccinated if they want it but after our more vulnerable children  Police and firefighters are in excellent health and will be able to live through this blown out of proportion h1n1 ",,,,,,,$$$

    Up to 400 are predicted to die   I totally disagree!!!

    My personal prediction would be between one to 200000 people will die from H1N1 

    And also I like to predict that if you go out in a heavy downpour without
    a raincoat/jacket you will get very wet very fast

    The spending of millions actually made sure those companies' computers WERE ready for Y2K  There is nothing wrong with being prepared    it's called being pro-active  Somehow I find it really fascinating that so many think ALL the governments of so many countries are trying to get their residents to test out this vaccine    I'm sure they sit around the tables in their secret meetings wondering how they can maybe use their people in ways that might hurt them  Duh    let's give this vaccine to all our people and see how many die  Come on people    use your head     it's safe

    There is something to be said about fear  not only is fear contagious it lingers for years and years and years  And yes fear IS contagious 
    Fear of danger is healthy  Fear also runs much of the world spurring on endless activity  The media and advertisers play on fear to increase market shares etc  Once fear is ones focus the endless worrisome events of the 'world' feed it  It becomes obsesive  fearful thinking baloons into paranoia it can generate neurotic defensive structures and then it becomes a dominant socail trend such as were seeing here  Fear limits growth  It also leads to inhibition

    It was wrong to jump the line they have the money they could have flown all their people to the US where they could have paid for the shots  Instead they stole from the public trust in front of higher risk people  This is nothing more than low class  I read the how the oilers showed more class than the flames by not taking the shot

    You are all fuel to this fire including me now! Reading some of these comments make me laugh  The vaccine was available to everyone at the time whether they jumped line or not  They are in contact more out of town more etc  This whole situation is ridiculous this whole H1N1 bullshit is ridiculous  To Robert the reason this H1N1 is even a big deal compared to any other regular influenza strain (which kills more people than a year than hini) is that it attacks anyone and can kill anyone  Someone who is old someone with a vulernable immune system someone who is in perfect health and a strong immune system anyone and everyone is at risk  The public is crazy    wait a few more weeks for the shot you waited all summer

    Maybe before posting your rant you should read the article and get your facts straight  Only 40 season ticket holders went to this meeting  Not 150 

    But I agree with the Flames decision  It was at a time when they were saying no one would be turned away  The Flames aren't the only ones who had their own private clinics either  Politicans definitely aren't waiting in line and the homeless had the shots brought to them  I am not complaining that they did  I just think people need to take a deep breath and focus on the future  46 Days until Christmas!!

    Robert the reason some of us are defending the Flames is because they didn't really do anything unethical  Everyone was advised to go get the shot    not just children elderly etc  If the vaccine was restricted to a small group at first then sure    the Flames screwed up bad and deserve to be called every name in the book  All they did was take advantage of an opportunity that was available to everyone 

Robert Report Comment
    November 9th 2009 11:34am
    Most of you all FAIL at getting the point here  Yes the players of the Calgary Flames are more prone to catching this flu then the average joe  From bus rides plane rides dressing rooms and community services ect  

    However you fans defending the Flames based on this ARE MISSING THE PROBLEM  A typical Calgary Flame player is in tip top shape  Had any player catch this type of flu they're more likely to get over the illness due to their tip top physic!!! the average child elderly person might not be so lucky  That is the point  A healthy young male/female can overcome the flu much easier then a small child or elderly person can 

    So yes it was wrong for them jump the queue!!

They were just being pro-active to provide protection for a team that everyone gets behind when they are winning  I think calgarians need to put this behind them now  STOP crying about what can not be reversed  Just move on with your lives everyone makes mistakes and Alberta Health Services made one too  I don't blame the flames in any way

    150 people were vaccinated folks - this goes way beyond just the players!

    To this date there is yet to be any acknowledgment by anyone personally involved that it was a mistake on their part â€“ basically they are trying to deflect blame with excuses like â€œthey decided to receive the inoculations separately to avoid causing disruptions at clinics â€ and as such a headhunt was launched with scapegoats being sacrificed to appease the masses 

    Long story short â€“ the papers that day ALL front paged the looming shortage and ALL 150 of these people chose to put themselves selfishly ahead of those at true High Risk due to complications

    Really can we get over this now? Yes the vaccine should have been limited to just high-risk individuals from the beginning but it wasn't  EVERYONE was told that they can go get the shot if they desire  Last time I checked the Flames were all people and had as much right as anyone else to get the shot at that time since it was available to everyone  If you're going to hate the Flames for getting vaccinated at that time you should also be hating half of this city 

    A lot of companies in Calgary organize private vaccinations    the Flames had the right to ask for it and it was up to AHS to say yes or no  They said yes    they screwed up  AHS investigated fired the people responsible  What more do you people want?

    We will always be in a new state of flu pandemic because WHO redefined what a flu pandemic was (took out the part that said high mortality rate)  It's always going to be about convincing people to get the new and latest version of the flu shot  Most people probably don't need the shot in the first place  Their own immune systems could take care of the virus quite nicely but they have made people believe that this is just not the case  So every year people will line up for the new (flu brew) vaccine  Does that not sound like an experiment or what? What might the long term consequences be? I guess we will find out years from now like we do with a lot of things (eg Vioxx) what the results of the experiment are

I guess they're S O L  As far as the children are concerned my question is why weren't they given the vaccination at school with permission slips just like they are for Hepatitis B or HPV?

many people in line were not high-priority and some families just cut into line with one member of the family who got there early  they need much more effective screening processes and tighter security at the clinics for this week

The only saving grace out of the mess these three stooges have created is that no one needs the vaccine so not being able to deliver it to the mass of fools demanding it is not going to hurt anyone

at 4:43 PM ETThe article says that clinics turned people away because there were too many to treat

However it appears from comments that people seem to combine these two statements into a negative and somehow come to the conclusion that the people were turned away because there is no more vaccine  This is not what the article says 

There may very well be a shortage but take a close look at the scope of the immunization program being implemented here  There are bound to be logistical issues  In addition also take a good hard look at the relative severity of the virus  This is not the bubonic plague it is a flu virus 

The people that are not part of the targeted high risk group and are still lining up to get vaccinated should show some maturity and go home until the high risk people are vaccinated  How can anyone put their life over that of a child’s life? Shame!

at 5:26 PM ETCBC reporting on the situation in Calgary is more hyperbole than fact 

The clinics in Calgary were scheduled to be open between 8 am and 3:30 pm  This means that only a certain number of Calgarians could be accommodated during the operating hours of the clinics  I was at the Whitehorn clinic  At 6 am there were 175 people in line  By 7 am there were 350+  By the time the clinic opened there were about 2000-2500 people in line at most 

Once the clinic opened everything proceeded smoothly and orderly  Yes there were a few who attempted to line jump but they were escorted to the end of the line by security  If anything early arrivals acting as placeholders created more problems than line jumpers as family and friends showed up to swell the front of the line  Police were on hand to direct traffic and ensure order 

Could it have been better absolutely  There were no garbage cans and no portable washrooms outside the clinic The lines outside the clinic were also haphazard  While organization inside the clinic was good it suffered from several design flaws that impeded flow 

That said my wife and I were in and out of the clinic in under 4 hours 

That there is higher demand than available supply of both vaccine and service is due to poor communication on this issue  The public has been urged to get vaccinated by government and media (in fact those choosing not to be vaccinated have been ridiculed by the media including the CBC)  Since Monday public health officials have been urging only those at high risk to get in line but have also said that they would not turn away anyone  Moreover there is no easy way to tell if someone is at high risk aside from gender and age  Diabetes asthma and other co-morbidities are not discernible at a glance

-------------
Sask you should get the facts  First H1N1 is not just the flu   it is a new influenza to which Canadians have no previous exposure  H1N1 is made up of both swine and bird flu and is highly contagious more so than seasonal flu  Information this week suggests that the H1N1 virus becomes contagious sooner and stays contagious longer than seasonal flu  The mean age of critically ill patients was 32 and the majority were female 

Second your claim that H1N1 primarily affects Canadians with other conditions more seriously is unfounded  See http://jama ama-assn org/cgi/content/full/2009 1496 

Third even though only a small percentage of Canadians will become hospitalized with H1N1 the number and resources required to treat H1N1 patients is considerably higher than seasonal flu  Again see http://jama ama-assn org/cgi/content/full/2009 1496

at 5:56 PM ETI think there may be *some* people getting in line who are not in a high risk category I think the real problem is really bad math  Did anyone setting up these clinics estimate how many high risk people are in any given area?

Calgary is a good case in point: it's a YOUNG city: lots of young families with pregnant women and small children  Add to that: what percentage of the population has compromised immune systems due to conditions like asthma? I have no idea what the percentage is but just from a general awareness how prevalent asthma is this criteria doesn't eliminate many people!

And yet Calgary had 4 - now 5 - clinics  Just looking at age distribution of the population it should have been fairly easy to figure out that this wouldn't provide reasonable access even only for high risk populations

It's unfortunate the young are the ones taking the brunt of this virus - but I see my town stream through the ER everyday I'm at work and despite the numbers I won't be taking the shot  I wear P P E  as my personal method (Personal Protective Equipment including a mask and an eye sheild over my glasses) everyday at work at protect myself from the public  These measures are only as good as your abillity to put them on and take them off properly and thus aren't for everyone 

   also the article said (near the end) Starting Monday supplies to all parts of Canada will slow while the manufacturer focuses on a non-adjuvant vaccine meant as an option for pregnant women  An adjuvant boosts effectiveness but can have unwanted side-effects 

I'm just curious how it managed to slip by everyone that they're still talking about this  I know MANY women here in Ontario who have received the non-adjuvanted vaccine on the advice of the Canadian Association of OB/GYNs (1-2 weeks ago)? Did this advice change at some point?

There were no headlines the other day when clinics in Ontario turned people away - not sure what you are talking about  My view is that most of the recent headlines were about Ontario and the rationing they were doing  I live in Atlantic Canada and I would suggest that the reporting is very Ontario or Western Canada focused so what you are suggesting does not make sense 
Stop trying to paint Alberta has a bunch of heartless rednecks - I don't see that in this article  I think you might be overly sensitive  I did not read all the comments and maybe it is there but the article certainly does not paint Alberta in the light you are suggesting 
I have lived in both provinces and the services in Alberta are far superior to Ontario - wow I am not sure if that is the defensive behaviour showing but I would be very surprised if this was true  I would also guess basded on this comment that while you may have lived in Ontario but you were probably born is Alberta

I absolutely agree that people on this list should be a priority  They should have vaccinated them first all along  What I don't agree with is Police Officers and Firefighters not meeting the provinces definition of a health-care worker therefor now not being eligible for the vaccine at this time

at 8:43 PM ETI live in Alberta  The lines have been crazy  I have attempted to get an H1N1 shot but have not been successful  I'm also a teacher so I will probably get the flu somehow  I'll probably have to take my sick days  I was at my doctor clinic today and he said I should get the shot  He also said that there would probably be vaccines available in the office next week  I hope that is true as the lineups are not working  I was in one line up today as it looked very short I got there just as people were being turned away  One lady with three young ones was justifiably outraged she had been standing in line for four hours with her babies only to be burned away 

I hope that everyone stays healthy with the shot or without it

at 8:46 PM ETIt says it all that we have a federal conservative government that cannot manage anything INCLUDING dispersing a vaccine to the provinces  Adding insult to injury that one of the longest standing provincial conservative governments screws it up even more efectively  The lack of leadership provided by Stelmac and Harper is to blame for the entire mess  Their lies about the number of doses available and the open access to the clinics definitely compounded this problem 

That being said I think those that have said this is just the flu have it right  People should remember that the vaccine was not effective for 10-14 days after injection  How many would still get sick - the people who got the shot on Monday are still not immune 

The people that were not high risk and did receive a shot did steal a potentially life saving preventative measure  For those that didn't get the shot there is no reason to panic  I am currently home sick with my 7 year old  We both have the flu (possibly H1N1) and are riding it out  We are both high risk because of underlying health issues - all we can do is be careful at this point  (In the context of my earlier comment about the time needed to become immune - even if we had been inoculated we would likely still be sick)  Use not-so-common sense wash your hands don't go to school or work if you are sick avoid large gatherings of people (e g  the long lines to get shots) stay hydrated rest and enjoy a few days off  Tylenol and Advil are now your best friends for a while

at 8:47 PM ETGuys good news!!
Your chances of dying from this are much less than the regular flu  This is all a big waste of money for an untested and unproven vaccine 
big $$$ for the drug companies but not much else 
This is all too little too late  Even if the vaccine was effective against this relatively un-deadly vuruis it means you have to now get a shot every year for each mutation until the governments of the world go bankrupt 

Going to school a friend of mine died from the common flu  It is sad but he was a relatively isolated case 
The reason young men are at risk during these outbreaks is because their immune system is compromised during the rapid growth and changes of puberty  So take it easy on your teens when they are feeling weak and don't wear them out with too much activity (hockey) when they are sick 
Most of you already have gotten the virus and have already passed it along and therefore have the means to fight it naturally 


You have been all part of the greatest scam at taxpayer expense since the bank bailouts

All those years of dirty oil-sullied budget surpluses and no social planning or spending made Albertans think they were superior to the rest of us and that only they had discovered the true path

I suppose the sick vulnerable and young will be trampled to death at Ed Stelmach's clinic to ensure H1N1 vaccine rationing is accomplished based on his Conservative Party’s first principle of bullies go to the front of the line 



Nonsense  Welcome to socialized medicine  From waiting list to wait in line only to be turned away  The government has been pretty much able to keep the waiting lists out of sight and out of mind for years but they can't hide these waiting lines  It's been a botched operation right from the beginning  They ordered 50 million doses for a country with a population of only 34 million and they claim they are over whelmed because they didn't think that many would get a shot  What were they going to do with it all give it to some other country  Alberta opens 5 clinics in a city of around a million  At the rate they are able to do them it would take over 6 months to do everyone  The flu would be over by then  But the real insanity is that they bared all the private clinics from buying any and giving out shots at business as they usually do

at 8:51 PM ETthe media has left people completely uninformed about this flu  dozens of posters here think the flu affects the young  why? because outlets like cbc and others have resorted to highly irresponsible journalistic methods to get readership up and spread mass panic  you should all be ashamed of yourselves!

do you know what the source of the claim the flu affects young people is? the fact that the flu doesn't affect old people  that does not mean that the flu affects young people it means it doesn't affect old people 

here are some made up numbers to drive the point across about this shoddy journalism and they're all guilty of this 

2005 regular flu - 100 people died from the flu  90 were old  10 were young 

2009 h1n1 - 50 people died from the flu  40 were old 10 were young 

in 2005 10% of flu deaths were young people  in 2009 20% of flu deaths were young people 

what the news organizations are doing is looking at the percentages and saying more young people are dying from the flu! 

however if you look at the actual numbers clearly you'll see that this is incorrect  what's actually happened is that less old people have died from the flu 

in total a look at the real numbers suggests that h1n1 is a less dangerous variant than the regular flu because it doesn't affect old people as much as the regular flu does 

however a weak flu isn't going to sell papers now is it?

Their are only two real solutions to this market failure  The government should negotiate a deal with pharmaceutical companies to maintain enough capacity to keep up during a crises or the government should invest in creating its own publicly owned vaccine labs with enough capacity to keep up during a crisis  If this is not done this crises will be repeated in future outbreaks

at 9:07 PM ETSask you should get the facts  First H1N1 is not just the flu   it is a new influenza to which Canadians have no previous exposure  H1N1 is made up of both swine and bird flu and is highly contagious more so than seasonal flu  Information this week suggests that the H1N1 virus becomes contagious sooner and stays contagious longer than seasonal flu  The mean age of critically ill patients was 32 and the majority were female 

This isn't your grandfather's flu

Just because we have not been previously exposed to this illness (although then again many of us probably were in the spring) doesn't mean our bodies are less able to fight it off  The immune system is quite amazing  Yes it's true that proportionally it kills more young healthy people than the regular flu  However the overall death toll is extremely low  You're probably more likely to get killed in a car accident on your way to the vaccination clinic  For the majority of us swine flu is e like the regular seasonal flu - you're sick for a week then you get better  The hype over this is out of control 

Just out of curiosity why did you mention the stat about the majority of the seriously ill patients being female? Why is that relevant?

In theory your comments seem sensible    but in reality they're not practical or advisable  Doses once they are mixed with the adjuvant and drawn from the vial need to be administered within 10 minutes  Nurses explaining potential side effects to individuals is a medical responsibility not a waste of time  I work in an area where the average literacy level is approximately Grade 7 level    one can't assume that everyone can easily read and understand the often technical language of medical documents  Reading the documents to a large group in no way ensures that people who need to understand will understand  They may feel intimidated to speak up or may not hear clearly etc  And as far as having a self-running video listing side-effects    there's also no guarantee that people are paying attention and understand the information  Not to mention that producing a video takes precious time too  Clinics have been running for less than a week - producing a video would take at least that amount of time 

Instead of the rampant complaining how about acknowledging that frontline healthcare workers have been going way above and beyond the call of duty to try and help as many people as possible in very very difficult circumstances  They have been trying to the best of their ability to respond to guidelines and unpredictable supply and demand that seem to change by the minute  They are frustrated too - but they still show up after hours on weekends and when they themselves are exhausted  So let's cut them a little slack 

If you're really frustrated why not volunteer to help out at a clinic? Maybe offer to read out the medical documents to people in line to speed things up?

I've heard that the consent-to-vaccinate forms take at least 15 minutes to fill out properly which is the main reason why there are such line-ups at the injection clinics  Most people probably have no idea what they're signing or what the legal implications are  I seriously doubt if people even read the forms before signing them

But if you want a conspiracy theory how is this one?

What does someone with asthma look like?
Family of a child who is less than 6 months old?
Someone that has undergone chemo for cancer and their hair has grown back in?
Someone with heart disease?

Add those to the obvious pregnant women children 6 months to 5 and you have a good percentage of the population

There is one large number of people who are high risk for this one and from what I could see in the lineup I was in essentially all qualified  I don't think there has been abuse of the honour system in Alberta there just is not enough people giving out vaccinations  Sure do a tighter screen but I think you will find the lines will be just as long and you are accomplishing nothing if all you do is slow them down more

The few years since that shot I have not been hardly sick at all  Is that because of the flu shot for just one year? Does some vaccine creator want to take credit for that? Or is it because since that year I have decided just to wash my hands a little more and stand further back from people who can't stay home when they are sick and insist on hacking a lung up on your back on the way to work?

What is the truth  That is all I want to know  That is all we want to know  Lets start making this society better by just telling us the truth or soon there may not be a civil society to tell the truth to

However the federal government didn't tell the provinces until a few days ago that there would be a week's break where there would be none  That's why now there has to be a re-planning  That's why people are now having to be prioritized

It's entitled Anatomy of the 2009 Swine Flu and can also be found at

http://snardfarker ning com/video/anatomy-of-the-2009-h1n1

It starts with an introduction to the October 16TH 2009 Symposium of experts gathered at the Council On Foreign Relations to discuss the current developments of the alleged 2009 H1N1 Pandemic 
Held for many reasons it's main purpose was to generate concensus and set policies for Health Media Academia and State and Federal Government for the Pandemic  At the heart of the discussion was how to get the American public to take the unpopular H1N1 vaccines 

I'll let the audio from the meeting and the video speak for itself  But it should certainly make some reconsider the above article as far as the true validity of facts or intentions being projected out to the many eager masses out here now

No  You don't get the flu from an INACTIVATED virus 

http://www hc-sc gc ca/dhp-mps/prodpharma/legislation/interimorders-arretesurgence/prodinfo-vaccin-eng php

The virus is inactivated with ultraviolet light treatment followed by formaldehyde treatment      

The virus in the vaccine cannot replicate 

Even in the case of live influenza vaccines the virus is attenuated meaning that it is not as pathogenic as the wild type and it wouldn't give you symptoms of the flu 

It's ironic that you think others are ill-informed!

at 1:26 AM ETFor God's sakes folks why is someone always to blame? The federal government and the federal medical officer were assured by the drug company in montreal that they would have enough does of the vaccine to cover all Canadians  That is still true 

No one said it would be available all in one day one week two weeks or two months  So lets get of this blame the government game 

The reason for the delay if you people did your due diligence is the drug company had to stop making the vaccine BECAUSE they had to make the separate vaccine for pregnant women which took some time  That has been now completed and are back to making the H1N1 vaccine for everyone else 

According to the Drug Company it will take about two weeks to get sufficient doses made that will immediately go out to provincial authorities on to the health care workers in the clinics 

Canada did not make up the news on H1N1 this is happening n every country in the world  Every country is obligated to ensure that H1N1 is kept under control in the population by first developing the vaccine ensuring it's safe and then as it becomes available to give the vaccine to all the polulation if possible 

Once we receive our shot we are immune for life  If H1N1 mutates at some point at least the population in most or all countries will have received their shots therefore will not become another cause of thousands of death world wide 

I am past 65 am in good health and have made no effort at this time to get my shot  I wanted to see the most fragile in our societ to get theirs first 

I am being careful when i go out I wash my hands when I arrived home immediately  I am not going anywhere at this time that would cause me to pck up the H1N1 flu

at 2:00 AM ETI feel guilty but part me feels like I shouldn't  I got immunized on Tuesday in Edmonton  I have had significant chronic health problems in my life but I'm not totally sure they qualify me as high-risk as they aren't immune-suppressing conditions  I also work at the university and am exposed to hundreds (maybe thousands) of people every week  The combination of those two things and a chat with my partner led me to drive to the Westmount clinic after work on Tuesday  It took just under 2 hours to get through the line at that time  The nurse doing the shot asked me if I was high risk  I told him I didn't know and he just checked off healthy on my form without another word 

Last week the government was telling us that getting the vaccine was the socially responsible thing to do and to go ahead and get it ASAP  They told us that there was enough vaccine for everybody who wanted one  I guess I just assumed that they were getting to the high-risk people  My mom lives in an assisted living facility in a rural town and they came to her building to give shots on Tuesday morning  Now the government says that it's the socially responsible thing to NOT get your shot and those of us who got it face condemnation 

So I hereby apologize for getting my shot to all of you on here who feel people like me should be ashamed of ourselves for getting it  I honestly thought I was doing the right thing at the time and being a responsible citizen  I honestly didn't know that they didn't have some sort of triage system at the clinics until I got there  I guess I just had too much faith in the system  Lesson learned

at 2:15 AM ETConfusion and yet more confusion 

There are two different kinds of risks being talked about - risk of catching H1N1 and risk of H1N1 contributing to serious illness or death  Two different risks  We all have some risk of catching the flu some groups such as young people have a greater risk of catching the flu but there are a few groups of people that if they contract the flu they have a greater risk of serious complications 

Pandemic just describes the extent to which a disease has spread and its rate of infection  It doesn't describe the fatality rate of the disease  As people travel more and more throughout the world there will be more pandemics  A good source of information on pandemics is the US Homeland Security site 

Organization and communication have fallen short but there are lessons that are going to be learned out of this by everyone citizens included  I hope the media who have played this like drama queens learn lessons too - particulary how to do accurate reseach  The one thing we can be thankful for is that most people who contract H1N1 although they may feel really crappy for a week will recover just fine 

I didn't get vaccinated as I am in the low risk group but a big thank you is owed to the front line staff that are manning these clinics  That is a huge and exhausting job  ( I guess the nurses earned their money for this )

True but distribution is not the major problem  It takes no real skill to inject a needle  Diabetics do it regularly  If a lab tech can extract blood from a vien two or three tines the diamater of a needle shurley they can hit the muslces of a shoulder  It would be relatively easy to give five or ten times the number of shots they are giving today if there was a real need  The real problem is availability and that is clearly a federal government responsibility  Up untill a day or two ago we were told there was 50 million doses avilable and today there is talk of injection cernters closing for lack of serum  No one knows how severe this flu threat will be but if children die from not having shots available all hell will break loose

Probably not that cut and dried  Adjuvanted flu vaccines are being used for the first time in Canada  There is some evidence adjuvanted vaccines provide a wider range of immunity then just that specific strain of H1N1  There is some hope for those that get the adjuvanted version that it may not have to be repeated even if the H1N1 does shift some in type  But yeah sooner or later a different type will come along that needs a new vaccine

at 9:36 AM ETIts a common expectation that when people are told or instructed not to do something      they will do it  That is just a reality of life  So when the H1N1 flue vaccine was made available to all of the public without mandatory instruction the obvious in humanity occurred 

What is puzzling about all of this is that the government knew that only 650000 vaccines had been allocated to our Alberta province with a population of approximately 3 1/2 million people!!!!!

So common sense would have easily suggested to our government health ministry (anybody in charge?) that if indeed only the sick the elderly the health professionals the children etc  etc  must and ought to be looked after first then MANDATORY vaccination would have to be undertaken if there was to be any hope whatsoever of these high risk groups being looked after first  But this course of implementation for mandatory vaccination of high at risk people first that clearly should have been improvised was not and hence this chaos brake down and total failure to look after the most vulnerable of our province  Where have we heard that story before    about the most vunlerable 

What needed to be done immediately prior to offerring to the public is now being finally mandatorily implemented  As in all matters of critical importance where and when people of authority and power fail I firmly believe that heads should roll and roll they must  I believe that certain people in government (Ron Leipert for one) is way over his head and that he must resign immediately along with that expensive dropped shipped import from Australia Duckett  Then a public investigation and inquiry must follow to find out how such a public program could have been so irresponsibly botched up ending in such failure

I don't understand why they didn't place a strict restriction on the vaccination clinics limiting them to priority groups  Yes there's no good way to absolutely identify high-risk people without a doctor's note but at least by saying clearly that the initial clinics were only for high-risk people and asking about health conditions at the door they might have screened out many people who are not at as high of a risk from contracting H1N1 and made it possible for those in greatest need to get their vaccinations first 

Predy's claim that they asked high-risk people to come forward first didn't matter much when so many lower-risk people decided they'd ignore that request and go to the clinics anyhow  I feel that AHS seriously failed people in planning these clinics without accounting for the problems of self-selection for early vaccination and the needs of priority risk groups

That in itself is a bit strange since a great deal of time and energy in the months before the vaccine was available was spent defining and publishing which groups in the population had the greatest priority  In essence they ignored the planned delivery model at the last minute 

Now they would have us believe that they are going to deliver the vaccine to priority groups only  It would inspire a lot more confidence if there was some indication of HOW they are going to (fairly) operate this new delivery model  Hopefully there is more substance to that plan than reported in this article

While errors have been made I must say I admire Preddy for being so open in his communication and I truly commend the health staff for the 300000 vaccinations they delivered in just 6 days 

Prioritized delivey will offend the most selfish while serving the most needy  As a society I think we would would benefit from practising a that kind of behaviour more often

Because of the vaccine shortage they have fallen below the targeted number  Perhaps instead of AHS cutting medical services to Albertans they can start by cutting the imcompetant people from the top

Here in little old Saskatchewan there has not been mass panic and long lines a combination of clinics and doctors offices have been used to provide the vaccine to those in most need  Eventually it will get to most everyone that wants it 
-------------------------------

The problem is that you likely have only vaccinated a handful of people  Administering the shot in a doctor's office has to be the slowest and most expensive way of vaccinating  I know they are not even interested in doing it and are sick and tired of getting phone calls about H1N1  They cannot efficiently deal with it while continuing to do their day job  Unfortunately mass vaccination is the only way to get the vaccine in somebody's arm where it will do some good

Thanks for giving us your expert opinion  The problem with your opinion is that you are playing a simple numbers game: by your logic H1N1 has killed (*so far*) fewer people than the regular flu so we shouldn't be worried  Except that H1N1 is killing people who are not normally at high risk from regular flu  You know young healthy people without any pre-existing medical conditions  A friend's child was on a ventilator in ICU a few days ago because of H1N1 

But your expertise apparently doesn't go far enough for you to be aware of these kinds of things  Medical advice should come from physicians and epidemiologists not from internet users of unknown qualifications 

No one should panic about H1N1  But you are in a state of delusion if you think we shouldn't try to fight it

That means a large random sampling of the general population has been immunized  While this does not provide herd immunity it will cut down on disease transmission and reduce the number of people who acquire infections 

So while it will take some time for immunizations to start up again it is still tax money well spent as it statistically reduces the number of people with full-blown h1n1 illness that would end up in hospitals or clinics

I don't think that is the governments' fault
between all involved with this mass vaccination
they have managed to panic both sides of the equation
they panic the one's that want the shot by telling there
is not enough
and they panic the ones not getting the shot by telling
them that they are being irresponsible and they are
the flu spreaders and are putting others(children)at risk

Can you catch the flu easier from someone who has been
vaccinated or one who has not?

As with anything only the truly panickable will be in line 

Remember we were all warned that the flu is at hand and rearing its ugly head all over the country  Chances are you may already have it according to them 

As with all flus not all will get it  In fact the infection rates for flus are about 30%  The media has made it sound like we will ALL get it  For 99% that get it less than 10% will need hospitalization and less than 1% will succumb to the illness or complications from it ( meaning an underlying condition ) 

Many will have no illness at all  Those that do will be sick for a time  They will call in sick stay home for a few days and then be back to normal  This flu has been REPORTED by the CDC the Canada Health Agency and the WHO as having mild symptoms 

Using absenteeism as an indicator for the flu spread is wrong  Absenteeism comes in many forms those that are sick those that are sick of work and those that are just sick and tired of getting up on a Tuesday 

It is interesting though that after months of telling us that we paid up front for 50 9 million doses enough for all of Canada and then some we are faced with a shortage  The easiest way to convince someone that they need something is to create a shortage  Tada      it seems to be working

I'm sure Mr  Spock would have asked for evidence that vaccines weaken the immune system damage DNA or cause neurological disorders 

How do vaccines weaken the immune system? They work by exposing you to the pathogen - either a live attenuated form an inactivated (killed) form or parts of it - so that your immune system recognizes it and can respond to it  Vaccines work by priming your immune system to recognize the pathogen  How does it weaken the immune system?

I've never seen any evidence to suggest that vaccines cause DNA damage or neurological disorders except perhaps the 1 in a million chance of Guillain Barre Syndrome which is also possible with influenza itself (so there is no added risk of this with the vaccine) 

Sorry but Mr  Spock doesn't think that your statements are based on facts

Alberta Health has designated all vaccination clinics as of November 1 to focus on High Risk individuals  Hours of operation will continue as previously scheduled  We have 300000 doses of vaccine left and need to continue to get them out at the same or increased rate and focus on people at high risk  This supply will last about 8 days and at that point supply from GSK should be back on track  If there is a short interruption at that point it will be better to have it then than it is to have it now

2) Canadians breath some of the most polluted air on Earth because Canadian winters keep us mostly indoors: windows shut breathing stagnant recycled enclosed heated air (home/office/malls/etc )  This is a great breeding ground for airborne viruses to spread rapidly 

3) Australia does not border a southern neighbour with 300 Million people  With the ability of Americans/Canadians to travel back and forth much more easily (i e  bus/car airplane train closer proximity etc ) the virus has the ability to spread amongst more people easier  We do not have a 2 hour plane ride (and an ocean) separating us from our nearest significant neighbour like Australia

I'd like to thank all of the healthy U of C students that lined up at the Olympic Oval's high risk clinic for not taking those at a higher risk into consideration 
______________________________________________________________
UC students did not organise the clinics your good old people-oriented Alberta Government did  You would think there would be a clinic or 4 in Calgary just dedicated to those greatest at risk that would have waiting done inside with seats  It would only make sense  It floors me our Government is not brighter than a 3 year old  Where is the common sense leadership? At this point I would just go with leadership!!

at 4:11 PM ETWe live in a society where the drive to sanitize has not only weakened our own immune systems but has focused on the 99 9% of germs which are not of significant threat to humans while leaving the most virulent to thrive 
Many of these hand and surface sanitizers play up the fact that they even kill e-coli and salmonella while playing down that some of them need upwards of 30 minutes of contact time to accomplish this claim 

I would not suggest these products cannot serve a purpose  It's just that the wholesale marketing them has painted a picture that has us putting our faith in them to make the world safe for us even while having a rebound effect  The germs are stronger and the people's immune systems are weaker  The muscle that never gets a workout atrophies 
And it sends people in blind panic to the nearest clinic or hospital more out of fear than common sense spreading around whatever bugs they may have (most likely just the common seasonal stuff) 
This could well be one of the worst seasons for common cold and flu just because people are not staying home when they have a sniffle but rushing out to the hospital or clinic for every body ache and headache 

Rather than a vaccine for H1N1 perhaps we should be focusing on a vaccine for panic and a booster for common sense  I bet they would do more to keep people safe and healthy 
Myself I'm just waiting to see how long it will take before we see people walking about with anti-bacterial moist wipes tied around their faces as masks! (BTW H1N1 is a virus not a bacteria  Most sanitizing products don't even touch viruses  But I do have a lovely assortment of Comet Pills left over from the early 1900's that will keep you safe from the toxic comet dust!)

A few notable failures: Constitution Political processes Education Communications Leadership Accountability Resource Management and Media relations 
Our constitution gives the responsibility for implementation of medical services to each province  Some handled it well e g  Saskatchewan but most others were dismal 
Political Processes  Most politicians do not want to be the bearers of bad news  They would rather leap out of a burning building than actively fight the fire  All levels are guilty of passing the buck on this one 
Education  Preparing a country for a pandemic is more than a visit to a website and being prepared to survive on your own for 72 hours  The lessons on hygiene prevention and social distancing should be part of our culture 
Communications  Mixed and confusing  Inconsistent and panic-inducing  Fail 
Leadership  No one wants to be the bad cop and set and ensure the enforcement of priorities and rules  It takes balls  None evident at any level 
Accountability  Perhaps we should have this word removed from the Oxford Concise Dictionary  No one seems to understand its meaning any more 
Resource Management  It is handy having a contractor take the fall for the shortage that developed  Truth be known there was no plan to prioritize and manage the vaccine resources

This comment is false and is like many other vaccine conspiracy theory comments that have been posted on this site 

The components of the vaccine are not untested poisons they are thoroughly tested ingredients many of which occur naturally in the human body  The vaccine has been tested in humans and found to be safe  If you are interested the WHO and CDC have good sites about vaccine myths like this one  I wonder how people continue to post things like that when much good reliable scientific information is available online and very easily at that 

Finally I would bet pretty much anything that this commenter has been vaccinated in the past and his/her good health stems partly from that  Ironic    

If you have doubts about the vaccine talk to your physician  There are lots of rumours in the rumour mill but a physician can help you sort through them

What percent is hospitalized? What studies have been done to see why some are so serious while some are not? For example does it depend on the quality of the initial infection? Does it depend on lifestyle? Do this flu initially attach the same area as other flues? If not why not? Why do some people have severe reaction to the organism while (I assume as authorities do not give us figures) others have a minor reaction?

What Pulsar and the other vaccine zealots on the website don't/won't tell you or don't know is that the clinical trial testing system for flu vaccines is of dubious scientific value and done by the vaccine manufacturers themselves  These vaccine companies are also exempt from any lawsuits stemming from vaccine side effects which will inevitably start showing up at some point  That alone should raise a lot of red flags

http://www ncbi nlm nih gov/pubmed/19851782

QUOTE

Programs for vaccination against the new influenza A/H1N1 targeting many hundred million citizens in Europe and the USA are to be launched in the fall of this year  The USA is planning to employ a non-adjuvanted vaccine whereas European nations are opting for inclusion of MF59 the adjuvant contained in an alternative seasonal flu vaccine or the related adjuvant AS03 that is contained in a recently developed H5N1 vaccine  We draw attention to unappreciated hazards of using adjuvanted vaccine in Europe  Evidence from animal experiments in conjunction with clinical epidemiological data indicates that quite irrespective of cause stimulation of the immune system may accelerate atherogenesis  Application of adjuvanted flu vaccines to individuals at risk may therefore aggravate the course of underlying atherosclerotic vessel disease with all the clinical consequences  The same may hold true for other widespread diseases that are propelled by deregulated immune mechanisms  Safety trials conducted to date have not specifically taken these possible side effects into account and unexpected serious adverse effects thus may follow in the wake of a general vaccination program  A prudent consequence would be to establish careful survey systems alongside with mass application of new adjuvanted vaccines or to hold mass vaccination in reserve for use only in situations of true need such as would arise with the emergence of a more virulent new H1N1 virus strain or to use non-adjuvanted vaccines in individuals who are potentially at risk for adverse side effects

Meningitis is a notifiable disease in most of the western world meaning it has to be notified and to Public Health and appropriate actions have to happen like follow up and monitoring of all contacts with the past several days  You may recall this in recent years in the Kitchener area of Ontario 

I doubt VERY much that any nurse would have told you this story 

The most likely and most plausible cause for the death is probably cytokine storm but this has yet to be determined I think  Cytokine storm can happen even with regular flu - another reason why flu is dangerous  This overactive immune reaction is most likely to occur in young healthy people and is believed to have been a cause of many deaths during the 1918 pandemic  It occurs when the body's immune system reacts to an infection dramatically extremely rapidly and overpoweringly causing the body to attack - and kill - itself 

It's not really easy to define accurately what the storm is—because it is extremely complex and scientists really don't understand how the cytokine reaction actually works  But it is well know and documented in many young healthy people

It is obvious from the fact that you can’t even spell thimerosal that you have no idea what you are talking about  Thimerosal (C9H9HgNaO2S or ethylmercurithiosalicylic acid) is an organo-mercurial compound and has been added to drugs and vaccines in very small amounts primarily as a preservative to prevent bacterial or fungal contamination of these products for over 60 years  It is currently used in more than 20 vaccines in Canada  Ethylmercury such as that in thimerosal is much less toxic than methylmercury and exits the body very rapidly  You will intake more mercury in one day by eating any food (not only fish) drinking water and breathing than you will get from the flu vaccine 

As for your assertion about squalene (which is an organic compound not a material) and vitamin D: Do you even know that squalene is a naturally occurring compound produced by all higher organisms produce squalene including humans? It is a hydrocarbon and triterpene  Squalene is a natural and vital part of the synthesis of cholesterol steroid hormones and vitamin D in the human body  All the vitamin D in the world would be useless even assuming it could fight H1N1 without squalene

Have you had to wait three weeks to get the vacinne for your high risk children only to find out as I just have that the high risk vacinations in our area that were schedualed for the week of Nov  9th are now being given to kids up to grade 6 some with no underlying health risks while we have no idea now when our sons will be able to get the shot or return to classes?

Don't get me wrong it is great that someone has finally figured out that school age kids are more apt to contract H1N1 in the school environments but seriously the kids with medical conditions in the school (all ages to grade 12) should be considered as well at the same time 

i am absolutely furious with how this entire H1N1 vaccine process has been handled within Saskatchewan as well as the entirety of Canada  What an embarrasment  I keep hearing that there will eventually be enough vaccine for all Canadians who want it but that is not the key factor     the bottom line is how soon will it happen and how many people will pay the price because of this infuriating situation!!!!!

The problem with the mercury in Thimerosal is how it is ingested---we don't inject tuna fish  Most people don't have any reaction to Thimerosal but some people can have a reaction 

Squalene is NOT approved by the FDA for use in vaccines  Squalene is NOT in the H1N1 vaccine in the US  Why? There's solid research that points to squalene as being the cause of autoimmune disorders in Desert Storm vets  The WHO requested squalene be included in the vaccine to make more of it go around  The goal here is either the health and safety of the world's population or more revenue from vaccine sales  (You'll have to ask the folks at the top which it is )

Canada will consider using more than one supplier for future pandemics to hedge our bets Butler-Jones said 
---------------------------------------
It was Jean Chretien's government in 2001 that signed us onto GlasoSmithKlein for 10 years (and received a significant one-time donation)  This contract is good until 2011 so we had to go with them  Should we have also created a second contract - I suppose so if you have buckets of money and are prepared to pay both  I don;t think Canada is in that financial situation and so far GSK has done an okay job with one hitch (the reduction this week)   The extra vaccine going to foreign countries is only the antigen because we do not have the capacity to inject it any faster  They said all along it will take until Christmas but Canadians want it all in the first two weeks  Get reall here --- in my opinion the feds have done a pretty good job  It is the provinces and in particular Alberta that dropped the ball by not following the guidelines

at 1:01 PM ETYesterday I spent some time in H1N1 inoculation lines in two different BC locations because the 1st location ran out of vaccine halfway through the clinic 

At the 1st location there was one person coughing for 2 hours within one metre of me and 5 coughing within 25 feet including several young children  I didn’t observe any coughing into the sleeve 

At the second I spent an hour in an outdoor line before being innoculated within one metre of two different symptomatic people (both with fevers one child the parent explained at 102 degrees only hours earlier) 

There seemed to be a misunderstanding among some people in the lines that if you have the swine flu you'd better get in line for the shot soon it’ll help you get better 

Until today in those lines I've had no H1N1 exposure (that I know of) and certainly none that was as close as this was 

If the organizers of this vaccination campaign don’t want to be promoting the spread of infection with their program instead of curtailing it especially in communities where active disease is widespread then they need to start screening people as they first join the lines (instead of hours later) to distinguish whether they are fluish or might be still infectious with it  People who're sick need to be directed to specialized health care and given masks etc  or to a different location where they’ll be handled by gowned and masked health care workers  As it was every volunteer worker who dealt with these people was also exposed and unprotected on dealing with them 

It defeats the whole purpose of the campaign and they’ll soon run out of health care workers if they're organized to bring sick people together to mill around with healthy ones without protecting the healthy ones as they do

Guess they’ve found a way to force parents to send their kids to school or fail their classes since schools remain open  Although most students getting the H1N1 will be fine; some and especially those at risk of complications may not … Sadly I suppose that if one of the students die they may change their minds 

School boards will not be liable since this a ‘mild’ virus and parents will blame themselves - it makes me wonder about the systems we live in  I suppose it would have been too difficult to not put any students health at risk by postponing school for several weeks until the high at risk or most students were vaccinated  It would have been too difficult to add a week of school before Christmas remove March break and add a week of schooling in June  Or business’s having some parents take their vacations early or/and if necessary have a few school daycares remain open (left to the parent’s discretion if they would require to send their children) 

Geez it’s ‘mild’ so what if a few die it will be an acceptable number because re-arranging school dates or work loads would be too difficult during a pandemic  There is no such thing as directing your own destiny -- our votes continue to put ignorant people at the helm

And little stories (true or not) about a person here or there with an adverse reaction change nothing  This is about two things and only two things - how many people could get this disease and can that be changed by vaccination and how serious are the cases going to be and how many could die and how much could this cost us collectively to care for preventable cases?

Everyone is entitled to an opinion and to decide for themselves  Hopefully more will be smart enough to protect themselves from a very serious disease  And hopefully those too stupid to do so will pay for their treatment if and when they end up in hospital  I respect your right to do what you like - I just have no interest in paying for you to be wrong

That is not 'said' it is a 'fact'   They are rare in that they happen in the one in a million times or with less frequency than that  Thousands die in Canada from the flu and flu related complications every year  That too is a 'fact'  Over 5000 have died so far from H1N1 around the world  That's a 'fact' too  I was in Singapore this June when they were getting > 200 new cases every day  That's a 'fact' too

I love this argument do you know why there are shortages of vaccine serum some years? Because not enough companies are making serum  So why aren't more of them making serum if it's such a money spinner? And yeah they're making money I suppose you do what you do for a living for free? They make money the same way insurance companies firemen and health care professionals do by providing a good or service that has to be paid for 

I have no doubt you had a bad experience with a vaccine and if you can prove that the vaccine caused you long term damage sue someone  You can use with the same level of proof you seem to feel is rewired of vax manufacturers: 100% certainty

I got the shot because I have asthma and whenever I have gotten a cold in the past few years it has turned into bronchitis that is hard to shake 
The people waiting for the vaccine were a mix across all age groups from very young to quite elderly 
I don't have any qualms about getting the vaccine  People need to remember that vaccines while side effects are rare have prevented devastating illness and death from diseases that are all but obliterated now  My husband's 50-something cousin is deaf because her mother was exposed to Rubella while pregnant  This is something that rarely happens anymore 
I won't tag everyone who listens to anecdotes and experts whose opinions are not backed by peer reviewed research as nutbars  But if I had kids I would not be looking to Jenny McCarthy and other anti-vaccine activists to be giving me advice about whether to vaccinate my family

How many billions of dollars that must rake in each time! If we continue to do that soon we will have no money for the most deadly pandemic of all 
I don't think we should be innoculating every person for every single thing that goes around especially when done to prevent diseases most of us have only a 20% chance of catching in the first place and the majority will survive from 

If we have truly deadly plagues fine but we can't do this for every single flu that's declared a pandemic 

What is a pandemic anyway? Wikepedia describes it as a an epidemic of infectious disease spreading through human populations across a large region for instance a continent or even worldwide 

What is an epidemic? Wikepedia describes it as occurs when new cases of a certain disease in a given human population and during a given period substantially exceed what is expected based on recent experience (the number of new cases in the population during a specified period of time is called the incidence rate) 

Is it wise to continue to blow so much preveniton money on diseases with definitions that couldn't possibly be made more vague? In so doing we could be damaging people's natural immune systems by never allowing the body to learn to defeat its own illnesses  That could cause us to require more & more innoculations as time passes until finally Corporations have walked away with all of our money and no one can so much as fight of the most basic flu

at 2:58 PM ETPEOPLE! Notice how these people all recovered without the aid of drugs! The strain was resistant to the money grabbing flu drugs which do not work in the first place  People still get flues worldwide with these “miracle” drugs from the billion dollar pharmaceutical companies!

BOTH these people recovered from this supposedly horrible virus (one of them 60)  How many of us have H1N1 right now and do not know it or got a random flu that was H1N1 but did not pay attention and just fought it off normally? I am betting lot of people got H1N1 and just thought it was a normal flu rested and went on like normal 

Look at the facts most people who have “died” from H1N1 were in the hospital for something else  Most people who are detrimentally affected by it are the really old and really young just like the REGULAR flue  Of the US children who have “reportedly” died from it over 2/3rds of them were in the hospital for other conditions and over half of them got OTHER bacterial infections 

“67% had high-risk medical conditions including epilepsy cerebral palsy muscular dystrophy and other neuro-developmental disorders the U S  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported”

Let’s take the US as an example due to its higher population  Around 200000 elderly people get hospitalized every year due to the flu and some die due to complication caused by the everyday flu  But this is normal and we do not panic about it right?

I think everyone should start demanding proof of the cause of deaths of these patients in the hospitals  Do you not find it fishy that people can fight off this like a normal flu even the resistant strain but when hospitalized they die?

You make it sound as if from one year to the next we have a completely different flu virus  It is not that cut and dry  The evolution of the flu is a continuum with small changes  The difference is that with regular flu we only really pay attention to it for part of the year so it does seem really different each flu season but it is the same flu as last year just more evolved 

The H1N1 vaccine is actually derived from a virus weeks or months old now  Calling it a current virus is pretty intellectually dishonest

Lily what on earth are you talking about? The CBC and all major media outlets have been talking about super bugs for years  Here's a story about MRSA from 2007: http://www cbc ca/health/story/2007/01/02/mrsa-superbug html   I only post it because it was the first thing to come up in a google search of CBC MRSA but you could easily find stories like this from years before  (By the way you may be interested to know that drug-resistant bacteria infect hospitals all over the world whether they have public or private cleaning staff) 

Please don't all of you be silly and assume that EVERYTHING is about media sensationalism  Is the Canadian Medical Association guilty of sensationalism when it tells us that it's worried about H1N1? Obviously not  It's sad when people think they are more clever than scientists in scientists' own areas of study  By all means use your own judgment on issues that affect your life but make sure your decisions are INFORMED and not based on your personal whims 

H1N1 has not yet resulted in as many deaths as more traditional strains of flu but it has a far greater potential than those strains to lead to a worldwide calamity  Even having said that no one even cares if you believe it or not  We're just asking that you take some simple precautions like washing your hands

I am sorry who are you reading? Viruses do not combine nor do they work together  This horrible resistant H1N1…which was fought off without the aid of drugs by a 60 year old…WOW…so deadly 

Both of you are wrong  The latest strain that Bayer International formed is a hybrid combo of swine flu bird flu and common human flu  They also sent out 18 packages of the stuff to different labs last year as well actually had a patent cure for H1N1 a year before it was 'discovered' 

That's just what I've read from different 'conspiracy sites' but after seeing the way the MSM lies to people I'd rather stay skeptical

at 3:31 PM ETSome odd comments today from our fellow readers  One says a new Tamiflu drug is being given out now which is different from the one given out in the spring  Another goes to swine flu combining with Avian flu 

But    Countries have been stockpiling drugs like Tamiflu even before the present pandemic and drug companies cannot just change a drug and issue it under the same name at the drop of a hat  Therefore any Tamiflu issued during this pandemic is not hot off the shelves new stuff  It's the same old drug

Also    world health organizations have been warning countries who've been using Tamiflu and other such drugs against the indiscriminate use of them as such usage will reduce their effectiveness  Those countries noteably China paid no heed so it's no surprise there are now reports of a drug-resistant swine flu virus 

Finally H1N1 has both the swine and bird elements in it already  So the dreaded and feared combination has already occurred

I see a lot of people are thumbing down this comment  Although a bit alarmist in nature he is correct  I have a family member at York studying microbiology and that is the standing opinion of the professors there and they have stated it several times in their lectures    All agree it is not a question of 'if' but 'when' it will happen 

Just to make a correction to you Thantos it already does have bird flu in it's make-up  But yes if it goes into a person that has H5N1 already it is very likely to combine inside that unlucky individual and will destroy human life on a scale never seen before 

Do all you nay sayers honestly believe that this is all to make a few dollars? All this hype is to sell a vaccine? While I will not dispute that it is great money     but I would caution you to look at the other side of the coin  What if it's not? just stop and flip the shoe and think for a moment that this thing is real and ask yourself what then is motivating the concern  If you can be that objective I think you will see that the H1N1 virus combining with bird flu in places like Asia could be the one event that would certainly make a lot of people religious in a real big hurry 

Or 'they' could be trying to kill us all with the vaccine for the new world order! I like this one too

Tamiflu resistant?

Last year the NYT reported that seasonal flu was tamilflu resistant    ha  Tamiflu doesn't work against the flu    so basically they are saying it doesn't work  Then ask why did many governments spend millions stock piling this drug?

The current version of swine flu has already combined with bird or avian flu or H5N1 
Not sure what all the speculation is about 
For patients with seasonal influenza that doesn’t respond to Tamiflu the only treatment option is GlaxoSmithKline Plc’s inhaled drug Relenza  Reducing therapies for the pandemic outbreak caused by a novel combination of avian swine and human influenza could be disastrous if the virus formally known as H1N1 turns more deadly Mercer said  Flu patients who are otherwise healthy and without serious complications shouldn’t get Tamiflu he said

Is this not the neocon way? The whole point of neoconservatism is to funnel funds off to the people that really matter - specifically those with financial interests in private corporations  This is the concept of Fiscal Efficiency - the use of public funds to generate wealth and efficient profit making opportunities 

People should not be confusing Fiscal Efficiency with Efficient Health Care 

A simple example of this is the compelling argument for the creation of CapitalCare Inc  All the arguments relate to the efficient generation of profits for shareholders  The fate of the patients is not relevant unless there are liabilty issues (law suits arising from abusing old folks)

This change in financial status represents a variance of approximately 40% of Alberta's total income 

Just suppose this same mistake occurs again in the following years of projections? 

Can Albertans allow these kinds of projections to continue happen?

at 12:16 AM ETI agree with Goldiesox - I would also add that the battle in Public Health care is unresolved from the time of Tommy Douglas when he first brought in the first public health care system in Saskatchewan 

The morality of some of our doctors combined with the lack of morality amongst many of our politicians has reduced the supply of healthcare to the notion that poor people will never be able to pay for the health care they deserve the rich are unable to obtain the healthcare they are entitled to because the poor continue to seek the services of the healthcare services 

I thought this theory highly unlikely - until I had to find a doctor  I used the term Unemployed instead of retired to see what would happen  Three doctors told me to find another doctor - (end of visit!) Another doctor even told me how he was scared for his own health should he become ill all because in his words -    There simply aren't and won't be the number of doctors to care for the population of Alberta with the present practices and policies coming from Alberta Health and the College of P & S 

Long-term care facilities are not the only aspect of our health care portfolio that are in crisis; mental health bed closures staff reduction notices and let's be honest - the removal of health care premiums - has reduced the amount of money available to sustain the public health care system 

The biggest laugh comes from the PR people in the Government who want us to accept that they will put LESS money into the department let even more staff go - ( RETIREMENTS?) and give us a better health care system able to serve a growing - aging - and sicker - population 

The level of incompetence coming from the Klein Government has indeed been surpassed by Stelmach and his band of idiots

at 4:04 PM ETThere should be laws that force us to wear masks when we're sick  There should also be laws for proper handwashing  More of a token law enforced only in severe circumstances  Even in Canada a first world nation with modern education I see so many people not properly washing their hands if they're even washing them at all in public restrooms  We need some way to 'voluntarily' change our habits before a major pandemic one day forces us to 

Masks when sick proper handwashing proper awareness of ones own germs (not spreading them around in public) and bylaws forcing businesses to automate bathroom doors faucets flush handles etc I believe would cut back drastically on the transmission of all sorts of ailments as well as make it that much harder for a super virus to spread through communities  If we were to do these things we'd slow transmission to the point where any epidemics could be contained before they become pandemic or vice versa 

If we get this done we would probably even have a stronger economy with fewer work days lost to sickness from the more common strains of flu and common colds 

But of course this will never happen  The majority of us are lazy ignorant and have disgusting unhygienic habits that will not be changed without a good nationwide outbreak of SARS2 to smarten us up

Why all the big hype?

I am sure currently we have more cases of the regular flu in Canada which by the way seems to be 1000% more deadly 

This was clearly a Hoax by member of the WHO with interests in Roche Pharmaceuticals 
The sad thing is when a REAL pandemic hits the WHO and the mainstream media like CBC will have lost the credibility to properly warn people 


http://www roche com/sus_csoc-acc_influenza pdf

In this respect Roche calls upon all stakeholders involved to understand their
responsibility and take appropriate action  Roche strongly believes that there
is now before a pandemic a unique window of opportunity for all of us to fulfill
our roles and ensure that adequate preparations are made for the protection of
society  Once a pandemic is declared this opportunity will be gone 

May 2008
I guess someone at the WHO gave Roche a year to prepare in advance for financially benefiting from this media driven panic always follow the money!

Two guess' as to what company the WHO has contracted out all the inoculations to?

CDC to mix avian human flu viruses in pandemic study

Jan 14 2004 (CIDRAP News) – One of the worst fears of infectious disease experts is that the H5N1 avian influenza virus now circulating in parts of Asia will combine with a human-adapted flu virus to create a deadly new flu virus that could spread around the world 

That could happen scientists predict if someone who is already infected with an ordinary flu virus contracts the avian virus at the same time  The avian virus has already caused at least 48 confirmed human illness cases in Asia of which 35 have been fatal  The virus has shown little ability to spread from person to person but the fear is that a hybrid could combine the killing power of the avian virus with the transmissibility of human flu viruses 

Now rather than waiting to see if nature spawns such a hybrid US scientists are planning to try to breed one themselves—in the name of preparedness 

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will soon launch experiments designed to combine the H5N1 virus and human flu viruses and then see how the resulting hybrids affect animals  The goal is to assess the chances that such a reassortant virus will emerge and how dangerous it might be 

CDC officials confirmed the plans for the research as described recently in media reports particularly in a Canadian Press (CP) story

If you're worried about your survival buy a gun not Tamiflu

at 4:56 PM ETWho is cashing in on the Swine Flu Fears?? Media sure hypes everything up    Millions are worried they might be the next one to catch the swine flu (H1N1) causing chaos at many emergency rooms across the U S  Out of 34 million people who live in Canada there are 83 cases over 300 million people live in the USA and they have 173 cases  Forty seven in the rest of the world  Total of 303 with the virus out of 6 7 billion people  The current strain of the virus has killed at least 10 people nine in Mexico and one in the United States  The Spanish flu was lethal killing at least 21 million people worldwide  The current virus isn't as deadly because it lacks the genes that made the Spanish flu pandemic strain so lethal  Since 2003 more than 400 people worldwide have been infected with the bird flu virus  About 60 percent of them have died  No cases of avian flu have been reported in the Americas  Is it good people are freaking out being more careful being on the alert??

The negative effects of the so-called swine flu will likely pale in comparison to the devastation caused by HIV for which the Canadian government in my opinion has done far too little in this countrysome 25 years the virus was discovered  Margaret Heckler of the American Health and Human Human Services said in 1984: “within two years a vaccine would be ready for testing; we would have a vaccine and cure for HIV in 5 years ” HIVer's are still waiting

So the governmet doesnt care because other than sick days there has been nothing zip and zilch  Maybe the whinning of a would the government wipe my nose for me snivler isn't enough to hit the alarm bells  Yeah the government cares but we don't have anyone dying here the is nothing and there is nothing to do  I think one from china if you are unhappy with the goverment you should head on outta here  I am sure Australia would love to hear what you have to say

Its funny when I go into the doctors office or hospital in the past you dont see the entire staff/patients wearing those damn masks   even if they come in for a flu or cold virus they still dont wear the mask  So why does it take this outbreak to all of a sudden care if other people catch your flu virus???

Oh I dont care if I transmit my severe flu with vomitting and diarrhea but god forbid someone catches my swine flue with mild symptoms    better wear the mask! Many husbands/wives/boyfriends/girlfriends will risk catching the plain old flu and still kiss/get close to their partners but for whatever reason with this its like they have the plague    a plague with mild symptoms its such a shame that when a REAL pandemic comes along nobody is going to give a damn because of overreactions like the SWINE of '09!

The irony here is that CNN and the rest of the media helped create this semi-panic and the taxpayer will end up paying for it 

If a country like mexico after 2 months or so is reporting a mere 100 deaths then this is not an issue  In that same time over 1000 people have died along the US border in the drug war  Think of it Mexico is poor and crowded and only 100 have died of this flu  How many died of the standard flu in Ontario last winter? Well on average 300 deaths 

It's important for the media not to over play this panic because one day there might be a real threat  After two false calls in two years (bird flu then swine flu) they are batting zero  Cry wolf?

The following article from 2007 is somewhat informative:

Scientists Recreate 1918 Flu and See Parallels to Bird Flu

The 1918 flu may have killed as many as 50 million people about 2 percent of those infected  Researchers say the outbreak started as a bird virus until genetic changes enabled it to spread in people 

http://www nytimes com/2007/01/18/health/18flu html?_r=1



The swine influenza virus isolated from patients in the United States was found to be made up of genetic elements from four different flu viruses – North American Mexican influenza North American avian influenza human influenza and swine influenza virus typically found in Asia and Europe – an unusually mongrelised mix of genetic sequences [13]

http://en wikipedia org/wiki/H1N1#Mexican_swine_flu

I think it's the avian part that has them deeply concerned not to mention the overall assortment it's made up of

The only people who are hyping the scare are the very same complainers  If they got scared elsewhere why do they come here and whine?

Even when a news story says the cases so far are mild these fear-infected people complain: the reported cases are few and mild so why does CBC spread fear blowing it out of proportion? Arrgh 

I for one prefer swine flu to the newfangled H1N1  The moniker swine flu has a certain je ne sais quoi cachet to it and is instantly recognizable

at 10:56 PM ETUm    correct me if I'm wrong but the disease was originally called the swine flu because it could affect swine right? It should be no surprise that humans can transmit it to pigs  In fact I have an old trivia book that mentions that very fact so I doubt that this is really the first reported case - perhaps of this outbreak 
85 mild cases of influenza in Canada and we're worried about what exactly?

RobForteath said this:
***
Now we can assume there will be a quick banning of North American pork products by many countries ostensibly for safety reasons even though the flu is not spread through meat products
***

This disease can be spread through the meat of the pig provided that that meat is not properly cooked  That's the key factor  Cook the meat kill the flu 

Even so again we're this panicky about influenza? This isn't the avian flu (about which I also refused to panic) which was a strain not yet dealt with by humans this is something which we've seen before 
The common flu kills a couple million people every year worldwide - the vast majority of them people in poor health or with compromised immune systems  And we're worried about 85 mild cases  Sheesh

Instead of newspapers trying to cause pandemonium among readers and hope to sell the most local copies of their papers and news stations vying for the most compelling and fear-of-God announcements to het the highest number of viewers maybe they should shift their focus on what really matters! Pointing fingers at Mexico warning people to stay away from the country will cause more harm in the long run than good  Many towns in Mexico survive on tourism  Now they are left with nothing  Why are we kicking them when they are down?? When mad cow disease was discovered in Alberta and the borders were are closed to exporting beef that hurt our economy like hell!! Now we are causing the same hurt to someone else  Seriously change your way of thinking your focus ignore the blown out of proportion news on this virus and spend your time and energy creatively! Love your family help your recently unemployed neighbour donate time or money to an orphanage in Mexico spend an afternoon volunteering in a local food kitchen stop and smell the roses!

at 12:17 AM ETThere was a televised comment from a medical source that the current strain of H1N1 virus does not seem - at present - potent  What's of concern is the virus is undergoing changes  The strain now in South America (start of winter season) has already undergone some transformation 
The 1918 Spanish influenza virus followed a similar patterm ~ appearing in April and being harmless at first before it mutated into a lethal form causing 10s of millions of deaths in the winter season (northern hemisphere)  Will we see a repeat in 2009?
This is the concern health professionals have  No one knows in advance how the new strain will evolve  I suspect infection stats are under-reported to avoid public hysteria  In the USA the race card is being played in some circles blaming latinos for the virus (which is nonsense)  Worry or panic replace rationality or good sense  Still the wise will take prudent steps now to minimize challenges we may face later should this become a serious pandemic  Enough said!

Federal quarantine authority is limited to diseases listed in presidential executive orders President Bush added novel forms of influenza with the potential to create pandemics in Executive Order 13375  Anyone violating a quarantine order can be punished by a $250000 fine and a one-year prison term

I had the enjoyment of driving through Mexico for 3 winters from 91 to 93 up to 4 months at a time (the last trip all the way to Honduras) 
I drove into Mexico City twice  Both times struck me as a Dante's descent on the highways in with the big Mexican lorries belching out acrid-black semi-combusted diesel smoke and the with the thick traffic weaving in and out of a laneless freeway missing at least 6-lanes-worth of white lane marker stripes making their own lanes as they drove the exhaust so thick that the green highway directional signs were coated imperceptibly in black  The environs were so dry the dust was ubiquitous  It is in a high plateau with some of the worst air quality anywhere      
Less than 200 mexicans - mostly from a city of ~24000000 soles - have died 
The air quality must be a chronic contributing factor to the fatality discrepancy

at 12:30 AM ETSo I guess the media will now be saying that pigs have been infected with the human influenza virus 

Seriously though the statement that the more public health authorities look the more cases they are likely to find is very true  If the media wasn't making a big deal about this and you caught the flu would you go to the ER or to see your doctor? No  You would just stay home from work for a day or two  Since this strain appears to be no worse than any other there is no reason for anyone to get tested  Sure it is scientifically interesting but how often do people normally get tested for the flu? Not very often  Even if you go see your doctor he may order a few tests to rule out other things but would normally just diagnose you based on your flu symptoms 

There are likely many more than 85 people infected by this particular influenza but those people were smart enough to realize that they had the flu without seeing a doctor  At some point in the future this H1N1 stain may mutate to become worse but right now unless you are very sick or immunocompromised there is no reason to be tested and no reason to see a doctor

at 12:30 AM ETA bill entitled the National Emergency Centers Establishment Act (HR 645) was introduced in the US Congress in January  It calls for the establishment of six national emergency centers in major regions in the US to be located on existing military installations  http://www govtrack us/congress/billtext xpd?bill=h111-645

The stated purpose of the national emergency centers is to provide temporary housing medical and humanitarian assistance to individuals and families dislocated due to an emergency or major disaster  In actuality what we are dealing with are FEMA internment camps  HR 645 states that the camps can be used to meet other appropriate needs as determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security 

There has been virtually no press coverage of HR 645 

These civilian facilities on US military bases are to be established in cooperation with the US Military  Modeled on Guantanamo what we are dealing with is the militarization of FEMA internment facilities 

Once a person is arrested and interned in a FEMA camp located on a military base that person would in all likelihood under a national emergency fall under the de facto jurisdiction of the Military: civilian justice and law enforcement including habeas corpus would no longer apply  

In early 2006 tax revenues were allocated to building modern internment camp facilities  In January 2006 Kellogg Brown and Roots which at the time was a subsidiary of Halliburton received a $385 million contract from the Department of Homeland Security's Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE):

at 3:35 AM ETSACRAMENTO Calif  -- Doctors tracking swine flu in this state are investigating a new theory: What if it didn't originate in Mexico but instead had been floating around the border region for months?

Growing evidence in California suggests that early flu cases had no apparent origin in Mexico  Many of the early California victims -- including the first two cases -- say they hadn't traveled to Mexico and had no contact with pigs  Some may have fallen ill before the first Mexicans did 

Those cases contradict the conventional understanding of how the strain originated  They could also offer important clues about the future trajectory of the disease  Other cases here and in other states as well as abroad have clear links with Mexico

This adds EVERY YEAR to the spread of airborne viruses 

So maybe this may be the time were the government finally may decide to make a law which would make it mandatory for employers in Canada to provide at least 5 paid sickdays per year to their employees

at 6:41 AM ETI totaly agree that it's a great idea to stay home when one has the flu  There is just one little problem with that: not every employer provides paid sick days to their employees meaning a lot of people will go to work regardless because they can not afford to be sick

The chance that these pigs could transfer virus to a person is remote

Seems a bit of a contradiction if one event was very improbable but did occur then the second event is also remote? Are scientists about to join weather forecasters and economists?

http://www newscientist com/article/dn17072-first-genetic-analysis-of-swine-flu-reveals-potency html

At first look it appears this virus barely has any spreading power at all based on analysis of the data at hand  Basically each person it jumps from->to results in it getting weaker and weaker 

I think we should all take a step back and not create another mad cow crisis  Not that we should be ignorant about this but caution should be taken that we don't get gripped by panic and fear 

There's probably been more suicide crime and deaths as a result of this failing economy then what this stupid flu virus can do  But I guess it makes for something new for frontpage news since there is no more wars to talk about lately  I guess its kinda like a bailout for our media

Part of the problem here is that people throw around the word flu casually  If you get this virus (or any other influenza virus) you won't be going to work even if you don't get sick days  You won't be able to go  You won't be able to get out of bed  The bone aching head splitting pain fever respiratory symptoms and sometimes gastrointenstinal (sp?) symptoms will keep you at home  This isn't a little cold that makes you feel yucky  This isn't stomach flu It's a real potentially fatal illness  Don't confuse the two!

However if this strand ever comes back again (recall that this is the 2nd time its arisen in the past 100yrs) people from our generation who've had mild cases will be immuneto it  Also it does depend on what kind of mutation you could still have immunity to a sister strand

I know that for the virus to make the jump from pig to human it would have to change it's molecular structure ever so slightly  Now since it jumped back from human to pig does it change it's structure back again or has another mutated strain?

To understand this society must look at alternate forms of treating diseases such as homoeophathy  If you study the history of disease and examine the Spanish flu homoephathy was more effective in treating this pandemic than conventional medicine

We were formerly told that this swine flu was named improperly because it didn't originate with pigs and it couldn't be transmitted back to pigs  This story shows just how little the experts know 

But I digress  If we tracked how many people in the world died of the common cold there's no way we could call it anything but a pandemic  So why don't we?

Why are we concentrating on a few cases of mild flu symptoms from a virus that can prove fatal in only the most vulnerable? What is with this global pig alarmism?

The Doctor claims this will be smart and sucessful since the strain isn’t that bad! And the propoganda is working well with sheeple galor calling in to throw blessings at the WHO and tongue lashing “Irresponsible” people who know they are sick and go to work anyways  Then you had this guy  seemed like a schill  calls in and starts asking if all these sicknesses come out of poor countries because peole there live with their animals!!!

Yes it's new and interesting because it's crossed the barrier between us human animals and the four legged animals  But we and only we can stop it's spread by performing proper hand hygiene and covering the mucus flying bodily functions  The sneeze uncovered can spray a minumin of 5 ft out in front of you  So cover it so you don't infect everyone within that radius

Summary of oral evidence: Dr John Wood and Dr James
Robertson National Institute for Biological Standards and
Control (NIBSC) 27 April 2006
Dr John Wood and Dr James Robertson are Principal Scientists in the Division of Virology at NIBSC  Dr Wood and Dr Robertson lead the NIBSC’s influenza group and their responsibilities include the control and
standardisation of influenza vaccines  On behalf of the World Health Organisation (WHO) the NIBSC is involved in the serological testing of vaccine trials the PREPARATION and DISTRIBUTION of INFLUENZA VIRUSES TO VACCINE MANUFACTURERS and the COORDINATION of EU STRAIN SELECTION PROCESSES 
That's right folks  Dr James and co  grow influenza virus for vaccine makers  we told you the vaccine WAS the sickness! They do this for WHO and coordinate the spreading of sickness for them to test systems and force investment and fear based control and profit  Could it be they coordinated with Baxter U S  to send the Avian flu to those 18 labs in Europe ???http://www naturalnews com/025760 html
Back to the summary  Drs Robertson and Wood consider development slow in EU due to limited public funding  EMEA have helped persuade
industry to invest in pandemic vaccines with introduction of the mock up files and by waiving regulatory fees and several pandemic vaccines are now in clinical trials 
So since public won't consent to dogma  they turn to Pharma to do initial investment by easing profit restrictions and fast track research publishing from Pharma Doctors to late supply a PANDEMIC PAYOFF  Proof? http://www iii co uk/investment/detail?code=cotn:GSK L&display=news&it=le

Who knows what multinational companies do as they hide behind sophisticated international law? So far Smithfield Foods Inc denies that there is no H1N1 in his pig farm regardless of its pig farm being at the epic centre of the outbreak  What scares me the most is short cuts these multinational companies take has a potential to cost millions of lives  Their focus is bottom-line  That is what happened in the financial sector  The outcome of what greed financers did is loss of trillion dollars  The cost of what greedy pharmaceuticals and food producers might do is better not to think   as it is scary  My fear is international laws give them wide latitude and loophole  I hope I am wrong

How is it possible that the virus can be passed from humans to pigs but not the other way around? They say we can't get the virus from pig but then how is it possible they can get it from us?

Of course in a couple of hours the school calls and she has to go pick him up and take him home because he was too sick to be at school  And it’s not like here in our community we don’t know that we have positive cases of H1N1 particularly in the high school age group there is no excuse to send a sick kid to school 

People like these are selfish they don’t have the welfare of their kids first and foremost and they have no qualms about sending sick kids to school to infect other kids

I believe that if we encounter it this year naturally or by innoculation are bodies response may be better when it gets to be more lethal 

At this point there is no way of knowing and even MD are not sure what the future holds 

The fear is not necessarily for 2009 but every year afterwards  And is it just fearmongering or is it based on something? Well just informed speculation by the best medical brains in the world  All the best medical people have come to the conclusion that this is a different flu than we have seen before  I think that leaves us no choice but to be exposed naturally which is best (providing you are healthy) or by injection  Good luck

Wow what a fascinating story! Just out of curiosity    what was the name of this town? Exactly how many months did the quarantine last and how did they manage to keep everyone from leaving?

And if you were sick you didn't get the day off or get sent home  You had to barf up a lung and bleed from the ears just to get permission to go to the nurse's office  And if you were sick the nurse made you stand outside in the freezing cold with no coat until you admitted you weren't sick so she would let you back in  Of course the school would call your mother and boy did we catch hell when we got home for faking being sick at school  Sent to your room with nothing but a cheese slice and a glass of water for the night

Vaccines work by prompting your immune system to respond to the pathogen or some component of it  They work because they alert your immune system to the foreign particle 

You could achieve the same result by actually getting sick by why expose yourself to extra risk?

You have to play this by ear  However I have been reading and listening to different sources and some of the statements seem to be contradictory  One place said that anyone who had flu symptoms before two weeks ago probably only had the regular flu and should have a shot  Then others state that all cases of flu are H1N1 now and earlier  Remember as with the regular flu not all people will get it  I have gone years without getting even a cold and yet all that time I worked with people who were sick tended to sick family members and so on  That is just the way of it

Would it be fair to assume that-since it's spread so quickly to so many people and 5 7 million are only the confirmed cases-each and every one of us has already been in contact with someone who was infected therefore making the vaccine ineffective?

If 5 7 million infected people came into contact with 2 people each that would make 17 1 million infected (or immune to it already) and if those extra 11 4 million pass it on to another 2 people each that would make      catch my drift?

If it's spreading as quickly and it's as contagious as we're being told wouldn't it have already passed itself on to the entire population already?

Hate to break it to you guys but for most things in life coincidences are far more often the exception than the rule  Here’s are links to the first and second parts of a presentation from the CDC’s Glen Nowak Associate Director for Communications National Immunization Program

http://www ama-assn org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/36/2004_flu_nowak pdf

http://www ama-assn org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/36/2004_flu_nowak02 pdf

It’s all pretty interesting but if you look at the second third and fourth slides of the second pdf you’ll find what Nowak calls his 7 step “Recipe” to foster interest and demand for Influenza Vaccines  If you refer in particular to steps 1 and 2 on the second slide you will probably notice some amazing similarities to the stories that have dominated the Canadian media since this past weekend  Coincidence? Well maybe but I’d seriously doubt it

Let me guess as soon as this H1N1 vaccine campaign is over reports of the delayed seasonal flu virus will start to surface and the vaccine manufacturers will mount a heroic effort to get the seasonal vaccine to the masses arriving at the precise moment when the seasonal flu starts it's       delayed seasonal assault on the public

What made these townspeople reconsider their self imposed quarantine and finally decide that it was safe to come out? And when they did come out how many actually died from this belated exposure?

Wow instead of wasting all that time to try and debunk what the other poster said in a sarcastic way (and the others that agreed blindly) you could have taken the 10 seconds to type a couple key words in Google

at 10:54 AM ETCorrection to an earlier post I wrote  Safe vaccines DO exist against four strains of bacteria  Other bacteria (such as plague and anthrax) have been resistant to attempts to create a safe vaccine  We will have to continue to rely on an arsenal of antibiotics to fight these scourges for the forseeable future 

Vaccines remain the most effective method to halting the spread of viral infection  Anti-virals (such as Tamiflu) only slow viral replication once a person has already been infected and ONLY if the infection is caught early enough 

There is no denying that mass vaccination has been shown the safest most effective method of stopping the spread of viral disease  Prior to the invention of vaccines people simply died or were disabled by polio rubella smallpox and other diseases 

Those who advocate against all vaccination fail to understand just how huge the toll in human suffering would be if we returned to conditions as they were a century ago  The slight (very slight) risks associated with vaccines are tiny compared to the undeniable costs associated with refusing them 

Our grandparents and great-grandparents were eager to vaccinate their children because they had seen for themselves what would happen otherwise

What are you going to point out? That something in the PDF resembles the media coverage of this pandemic and hence they MUST be connected? Where's the evidence that those PDFs have anything to do with this pandemic?

You're just jumping to conclusions and treating anyone who doesn't accept your silly tentative links as morons  If you're right then there should be more evidence than some random PDFs you found on the internet

at 6:41 AM ETThis is the best article I have read on what is going on in society with respect to this H1N1 virus  The battle fields are in our classrooms and schools  What some experts for get is that a school is not like the mall etc  Kids spend way more time in close confines with classmates/school mates  Kids don't have a choice who they come into contact with when they are in a classroom  Kids eat their food in the infected unclean classroom or cafeteria or while sitting on the hallway floor - as they do in the highschool where I teach 

All of this begs the question - why weren't the flu shots commenced in our schools? Schools are being hit the hardest  All of the stats given in this article match what is happenning in my school  I don't see this kind of spread in any other institutions anywhere in our society 

Those that elected to leave schools open have no clue as to what goes on in schools and the level of cleaning service that cuts over the last 12 years have resulted in  My portable blackboard is being cleaned with the floor broom/mop located permanently in the portable b/c the cleaning staff don't have the time or supplies to tote a cleaning cart filled with supplies around outside

Easy to say now but she should of probably waited a few more years to start up a business probably at least until her children are in school  This way she could save a bit more possibly work somewhere with benefits so if she or her children get sick they are covered

and for the CBC to suggest this woman's problems began the day she started coughing with a fever is very poorly researched journalism

I hope she gets back on her feet - but I think a job as an employee rather than an employer might be a better alternative than running a high risk business where one has no benefits or safety net if they get sick

All new small businesses are high risk restaurants are among the highest failure rate of any business in general  I tend to agree with those that say that granting this loan in the first place was not the wisest move 

Sunnyboy:

It isn't mean spiritedness but acceptance of reality  I would love to run my own business be my own boss etc but I have a family to support so I work at a steady job with decent benefits that make it possible to support a family until my kids are all old enough to look after themselves  When that time comes then perhaps I will start my own business 

Vigilante:

It is great if you want to help her out  That is the wonderful thing about living in a free society you can look her up and send her whatever money you want in order to help her  If she turns the business into a successful enterprise then she may even pay you back one day  That is how investment works  You assess the risk vs benefit and make your decision as a lender  If you want to give her money with no expectation of return then your charity is commendable but as with all acts of charity we must each make our own decisions as to who and what we want to support

I agree with many commentators here that she was probably not in the best circumstances to start a new business especially one as difficult to operate as a restaurant (I spent many years in that business myself and know how unbelievably thin margins can be)  However I am also of the mind that the masses will almost always tend to security over risk and will rarely if ever find themselves in ""right enough"" circumstances to actually step up to attempt to reach extremely high goals 

As a ""neighbour"" (simply by residing in the same city) a taxpayer and a supporter of those who strive to improve their lot I will absolutely do my part to support her  Even though I don't tend to eat vegetarian I will go well out of my way to visit her restaurant before the weekend arrives in order to support her  If it is good I will go back again next week 

That is how taxpayers should support small business  With their own wallets and their own choices

at 11:30 PM ETThis is precisely why I am so embarrassed to live in Calgary  Only in this city do people truly believe there is something wrong with those less fortunate 

The ignorance about issues related to poverty is quite apparent by the posts in this thread  Do not confuse income support with a business bailout  Income support is to help cover personal expenses like feeding your kids or paying your home rent so you don't become homeless 

Believe it or not there are many people who cannot participate in the traditional workforce  Maybe they have poor education a language barrier a physical disability etc  In this case it sounds like this woman didn't have the luxury of maternity leave like so many of you take for granted  How do you pay the bills then? Many times self employment is a last resort to provide a decent living 

Everyone knows that the first year in business is the hardest  Even those with the best laid plans can fold  How many new entrepreneurs can afford health insurance? Not many  How many new entrepreneurs can afford staff to cover you while you are away sick? Not many  This type of situation can happen to any entrepreneur 

To each of you coming down on this woman I only hope you remember your words if you ever enter poverty  Shame on all of you  She is doing what she can to not live off the system and be a contributing member of society

Or does ""single mom"" mean she gets a reasonable amount of child support from the father(s) of her children and they are in the child's life just as much as she is?

I ask because I know many people who refer to themselves as ""single parents"" when the only difference between how their children are being raised and how other children are raised is that their parents just don't live under the same roof but are both just as involved in the child's lives as they would otherwise have been  I've even heard people refer to themselves as ""single parents"" when it is the other parent who has custody of the child nearly 100% of the time

this is not about Calgary - this is about people getting tired and sick of these ""poor person down on their luck"" stories the media like to sensationalize - how this is about H1N1 is beyond me - this is about bad decisions and people lending money that should have never been lent - simple

Single-Parent meaning that there is a separation from the father  With an 8 month old it sounds expensive  Child support payments are rarely reasonable and are dependent upon how much the her ""Ex"" was making the previous year  Even with her own business daycare for a two year old and an 8 month old then food diapers rent and a vehicle it's hard to even feed yourself

She states in her interview that she has basically no equity  Even if she was getting support payments from a father they certainly wouldn't be for her buisness but her child? Her issue is that she's trying to make a life for herself and she gets shot down with the flu  An unfortunate circumstance and she's reaching out for help  Asking for help is a noble quality and nothing to be ashamed of

However for those that say 'this isn't news' I would have to agree with you  Despite this I see no problem with giving her this type of publicity  I might stop by and check out her restaurant  If she's working hard to keep herself out of the hole I'm happy to be a supportive neighbour  So to all the people that truly wish to see more stories about Iraq Afghanistan and war crimes in Darfur I ask if you can't take a moment out of your day and realize that maybe the reporters felt like giving this woman a break?

Good luck to her - we all need to survive  It takes a fighter though to go for what will give you some fulfillment in your life  All rock stars athletes and celebrities were given a break in their life that allowed them to pursue their dreams  And while I agree that there are people all over the country reaching and never given that break    this woman seems to have gone through a lot - what's so wrong about extending a helping hand?

Dr  Mercola's Comments:
There is plenty to be optimistic about as it seems the tide may be slowly turning on this swine flu debacle showing it for the hoax it really is 
European scientists are now demanding answers to the growing inconsistencies 
And while many so-called scientific experts have criticized me and others who have spoken out about this senseless mass-vaccination campaign more of the scientific community is now coming to the same conclusions we’ve been talking about for months 
It looks as though the swine flu pandemic of 2009 will go down as one of the biggest government and pharmaceutical scams ever renewing a healthy and necessary skepticism about the swine flu vaccine and the dubious dealings behind the implementation of worldwide mass-vaccination programs 
On the upside it has also created a more open debate about vaccinations in general 
The childhood vaccination schedule is in dire need of an overhaul and the swine flu hysteria has actually opened many people’s eyes to the unhealthy practices behind our vaccine policies  The public is finally starting to wonder and question en masse what’s being injected into them and their children

Dr  Corriveau do you realize that the objective of a vaccination program is to get the vaccine into the arms of the people who may get sick and die if you don't? The priority is not controlling lineups by limiting administration to obscure groups  I'm amazed that you didn't dedicate a day for pregnant nuns 

If you want to do your job then open more clinics  Put nurses in the schools to vaccinate the kids  Read your pandemic plan and use the other resources identified in it to do the vaccination such as emergency responders 

Do you realize that people work during the week? Kids go to school during the week? Increase the hours of the clinics on weekends not reduce them 

You should be totally ashamed that Alberta has 500000 doses on hand  They should be in our arms  The Feds have just announced 4 8 million doses for next week  Are you prepared to administer them in less than a week? I really doubt it 

Alberta has the second highest provincial death rate per million people not counting the last two you announced today  We are nearly double the national average

The highest cases of hospitalization and death are in people with a median age of 25-48 most of who have pre-existing medical conditions  Alberta has left this high risk group as the last priority for the vaccine to this date not giving it to them  Its absolutely irresponsible of them to ignore the facts  I've contacted AHS and they give me the canned response that they are following Health Canada's guidelines for priority groups  I find this very hard to believe since all other provinces have gone a different route 

Whoever is in charge is not making decisions based on facts  I have zero confidence in their ability to provide basic vaccinations yet these are the ones who are going to drive our medical system forward  They need to be thrown out now they are incompetent and unable to handle the most basic of tasks

at 11:46 PM ETFunny (funny sad not funny ha ha) how the people who have already received their precious shot most of who were not in a high risk group but lined up anyway selfishly taking up space and the shot that children should have had are now smugly sitting back and telling the rest of you to relax this virus is no big deal
How pathetically inaccurate is that ?

PS
I think it is a very big deal when the WHO has this virus at its highest warning level in their history 
Level 6 
The United States Government said today death's in the US from this virus have overtaken their average seasonal flue numbers  ( That Statement alone should take care of all the arm chair self appointed pandemic experts)
34 dead in Alberta and everyday going up by 5 or more 
The Alberta Government just ordered more than a 100 new ventilators from the Federal Governments emergency stock pile in Ottawa on top of the new ones they ordered earlier this summer from the manufacture 
As your lungs start filling up and are literally being eaten away by this virus you are put into a medically induced coma and one of these prized ventilators will then breath for you 
We have over 100 people in rough shape in hospitals across Alberta right now with more coming in everyday 
And it's only November we have a long way to go until April/2010
The last of the people to get vaccinated will be the end Dec/09 says AHS 
Before your turn comes I hope you have talked to your Doctor or a health professional do your research 
I hope you will go down there and get your shot 
Playing Russian Roulette with your life or your child's life is not worth the risk and the risk is getting higher by the number of new cases and deaths each day 
Good Luck

Among children under 18 about 8 million are believed to have been sickened 36000 have been hospitalized and 540 have died a much higher number than the 129 laboratory-confirmed child deaths the CDC reported November 6 

The prevalence of flu cases is higher than at any time since the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic she said

In a weekly update the WHO's point person on the H1N1 virus Dr  Keiji Fukuda also warned the public not to treat the virus like just another flu 

But unusually for influenza Fukuda said H1N1 continues at high levels over the summer months and many of the serious illnesses and deaths are concentrated in people younger than 65 

Some people are tempted to dismiss the infection and think it's not serious  But Fukuda said that's a dangerous mind-set

at 10:58 AM ETAs one of the nurses who has been working at the vaccination clinics I share the poor evaluation given the AHS re: this campaign  Two things are very difficult to understand  The first is why it took an entire 6 days to change the plan from everyone is welcome at the clinics to a focus on high risk groups  The need for this change was crystal clear by the second day  The other as if not more troubling is why the AHS has chosen such a slow roll-out of the vaccine for the high risk groups much slower than all other provinces  To my knowledge none of the clinics have been busy for the entire week since they restarted and we have not run out of vaccine  I have spent most of the week with little to do at one of the sites and it has been one of the most frustrating weeks of my career  I feel an urgency to get all people with underlying conditions vaccinated and feel we could have completed this if all people under 65 with chronic conditions had been able to come in during the last week  I personally have 4 close family members aged 20 to 49 with asthma or immune system problems ho have not been vaccinated yet and I have spent many well-paid hours during the past week doing nothing  It has been very demoralizing 

I cannot understand it as past public health vaccination campaigns have gone very well  This is the largest yet but there are so many inexplicable decisions  My current analysis is that decision making has been very centralized in Stephen Duckett's office and that the politicians are terrified of having a picture of a line-up in the media  I say bring on the line-ups--we vaccinated 2000-4000 people per day per site in the first week and in the past week it has probably been 200-400 per day (I do not have firm figures)

The long lineups and confusion that others experienced will be redux as a warming of the perils of socialist medicine and a demonstration of the manifest destiny of wholesale privatization  The regressive base knows that there will be no lineups at all in the new privatised system provided that prospective patients pass the appropriate wallet biopsy  After all healthcare works perfectly in the US - Glen Beck said as much on his TV show!!

For the last 2 years + all you've seen on the news is Bird Flu Swine Flu Instant death the world is doomed and your neighbours will be eating their children in the next six weeks  If your relatives are sick lock them in the basement QUARANTINE QUARANTINE!! DOOM DOOM DOOM!!!!!

And now when it does break out the gov't has the audacity nay the stones to say no one expected this kind of rush 

Well if you drive fear and doom into peoples brains for a period of years then say get your fix now here!!!!       but only if you really need it the odds are you're going to get a bit of a rush at the door 

The failure to see this coming is not only one of management but of competence and common sense  Par for the course for albertas natural governing party

Apparently we in Ontario have low standards 
---------------

This was an opinion poll not a measure of how effective the roll out was  Albertans have strong opinions and expect a high level of performance  Alberta vaccinated 15% of the population in 6 days  Ontario took 12 days to vaccinate 2 5% of their population  Now that is truly pathetic 

Alberta's NetCare system works now and Ontario's eHeath system may never work  Yes Albertans expect more get more and yes do complain more when they don't get it

You dream in technicolour! Every other province has changed the governing party several times in the last 40 years and have healthy oppositions  Alberta has had the same party for 40 years and has consistently had virtually no opposing MLAs

I will agree that Alberta is not a welfare province as it consistently ranks in the bottom in half in-terms of the delivery of public services and management of the welfare of the public  Poorest marks for H1N1 management is just one example  I invite you to look at the news stories for Alberta and see how many public health issues are going unmanaged and unaddressed

at 10:29 AM ETTell yourself what you want but Alberta services are terrible  I was born and raised there and have since lived in three other provinces (but i have been back)  Albertans live in a naive fog thinking that soemhow their crafty policies have resulted in an economic tiger  Yet the economy remains undiversified and completely dependent on hydrocarbons 
The arrogance and ego of my fellow Albertan's as they whine about being net-donors of federal transfer funds makes me sick  Because they ignore the fact that Alberta was a net recipient of transfer funds for about 80% of its 104 year history  And very few Albertans are willing to acknowledge that the federal government poured billions into the initial development of Suncor and the oil sands  Just as it did to develop Hibernia in NFLD  I will even dare to mention that it was Trudeau who made the intitial federal investment 
Alberta's delivery of public services is terrible and disgraceful  I know this from personal experience  My first professional job was for Alberta Environment - What a shameful joke  My last experience with an Alberta Government Istitution was an aweful struggle with Alberta's weak & flawed Health Care System which precipitated my mother's demise 

There are many things i love about the province of my birth including the work ethic of most of its citizens but you must not let your heads swell unjustifiably 

40 years of uninterrupted and unopposed one-party rule has certainly not benefitted Alberta's Social Services

at 2:39 PM ETSo after half a year 1700 Canadians have been hospitalized with H1N1 and 101 have died 

In that same time it appears 10000 Canadians will have been hospitalized for seasonal influenza and between 2000 and 4000 will have died 

While each individual death is obviously a tragedy I still don’t understand what the H1N1 panic is all about  The numbers just don’t seem to support the level of fear many are experiencing 

Even if H1N1 ultimately turns out to be 10 times more deadly that it has proven to be to date which seems unlikely H1N1 will still cause less than one half the deaths we experience every year from regular seasonal influenza 

If you’re in a high risk group you probably want to get a shot just in case  If you’re not the odds of you being adversely affected by H1N1 are so close to zero that they are statistically meaningless 

There’s a great book by Ottawa Journalist Dan Gardner called “Risk: The Science & Politics Of Fear ” In it he makes the point that we are the wealthiest and healthiest humans who have ever lived on the planet and also the most fearful

Otherwise healthy people can die from it as well as people with underlying medical issues  It doesn't discriminate all that much apart from leaving a distinctive signature where children under 5 aboriginal peoples and those with heath issues are concerned  It can take the life suddenly of a perfectly healthy adult or child 

The second distinctive feature of H1N1 is how much more widespread it is at the beginning of the flu season than the regular flu has been in the past  It has many earmarks of a virus that could mutate into an increasingly more threatening illness 

I take this flu seriously because these factors leave me little other choice

November 4 2009
Dr  Russell Blaylock discusses the real myths on his website russellblaylockmd com in a section which entails “Swine Flu Data” where he provides scientific references and evidence to support his claims 

Dr  Leonard Horowitz has recently released a report which outlines how Obama’s recent national emergency declaration is advancing media hype deadly vaccinations and depopulations agendas  In addition he released a youtube video which outlines the key components of the report and details why government establishments are creating artificial scarcity myths via “shortage marketing” techniques to promote their agenda 

There are literally hundreds of mainline reports on a weekly basis which are reversing the reality of facts and myths on the pandemic  So called H1N1 vaccine experts and advocates are losing their credibility at lightning speed and they know it  They must resort to such tactics to maintain their weakening grip on the strengthening minds of the public who are awakening to the reality of vaccines  They are being defeated by real science and information that only exposes one thing… the truth!
Finding the economy a little tough going lately? Are you noticing that prices seem to be going up and up even on groceries? Do you find that your lifestyle is becoming crowded with restrictions and new laws and taxes that have come out of nowhere?
Take a look at what has been going on and being planned for all of the world's citizens by our Governments and the United Nations give yourself a fighting chance decide for yourself and research the facts after you watch the video:http://www youtube com/watch?v=VebOTc-7shU

Healthy kids between 5-18 years old have made up over 50% of all cases and deaths  Look it up on the WHO site  No underlying health problems  It's well documented in various studies that H1N1 attacks healthy immune systems - from which the immune system overreacts and causes blod clots in the lungs  Look it up  What's the death rate to confirmed cases? About 1 2% right now  How many people catch it? The current rate is 20-30% of the population  If you know the size of the population then do the math 

The Ontario Ministry of Health website says that normally between 100-150 people die each year from seasonal flu in Ontario - the largest province  Just the flu not pneumonia and other secondary conditions that develop afterwards  You wouldn't be dead if you didn't get the flu first  So quit with the 10000 - 40000 numbers

Is the paper bias for one or another political view?

If someone says Canada is doing better what was the source of that information? Was there a large group or a small group that the stats were based on?

Information has not been at all easy to get on this issue 

Most certainly no political party is quoting info that will make them look bad 

And no political party is trying to make the other guy look good 

Refer to this link for the Liberal view  Since all we hear on the news are quotes from the Conservative Health Minister read what the Liberals say

It is probable that the H1N1 mess happened because governments are so afraid of informing the public  The Harper government is very much in favour of controlling what information goes out  ie  MPs not accessible for important comments  Press Conferences managed by PMO  etc 

In other words if a government controls everything then they have to take it on the chin when that lack of info creates serious problems as in the H1N1

That may be logical but that is not necessarily what is happening and it is not what has happened with H1N1 in the worst of times in the past  Healthy young people were its victims 

I have read or heard that the thing about this virus is that it has tricked victims’ immune systems into attacking their own bodies which means that healthier immune systems attack more vigorously  Has anyone else heard this and can you provide a reference?

One kind studies trends and statistics - the conclusions are dependent on among other things selection of the sample  You can fund and custom order any conclusion you want since there are too many hungry second rate scientists  You can't repeat the study with the same sample nor can you modify the study easily  Hack you can call this soft science social science pseudo science even junk science 

The other kind involves a lab  Much harder to fake since some one in another lab can relatively easily duplicate your experiment  This is hard science 

I have a lot more respect for hard science and yes I am skeptical about soft science 

Guess who is getting all the press coverage? Press coverage also leads to more funding  And it feeds on itself

And so dos the seasonal flu just none of it gets reported  Anyone can die from ANY virus including the common cold it just depends on your body and its reaction to the virus  If you think the seasonal flu only kills people 65+ with serious health issues give your head a shake  It does kill healthy people and does kill the odd child EVERYYEAR

According to Canada flu watch website
http://www phac-aspc gc ca/fluwatch/09-10/w42_09/index-eng php

There have been 4520 confirmed cases of the H1N1 flu as of Oct 24th2009  There have been 92 deaths from the H1N1 as of Oct 24th 2009
That is a 2% mortality rate of CONFIRMED cases how many people do you think have caught it and never reported it or had it confirmed add those people at mortality rate dips well below 1% 

Of those who died 79 7% had underlying medical conditions which does not include pregnant woman (4 pregnant women have died which are included in the high risk group very sad but no different from seasonal flu)

The stats don't lie the H1N1 virus is NO worse than the seasonal flu it is killing victims of a younger age demographic than normal but it also killing less people than normal due to older people having immunity from the 1950's H1N1 strain

Before someone is diagnosed with H1N1 they are given a blood test to confirm that it is in fact H1N1 and not regular flu therefore if your friends were truly diagnosed it is not just the flu  My daughter is a front-line health care worker in a children's hospital and they are overwhelmed with large numbers of H1N1 patients many of whom are very seriously ill some requiring being placed on respirators  From first hand reports I do not believe it is media hype

MaryClarke by my count this is the fourth time you've posted the very same paragraph (with the very same typos) as commentary on H1N1 news stories 

I won't argue relevance but will point out that your claim isn't entirely correct  Hedy Fry didn't suggest that members of Parliament should get their own H1N1 clinic on Parliament Hill  In fact what the MP said was: There should be a clinic on the hill for all the workers on the hill that are at risk  When asked if this included Members of Parliament she replied: Members of Parliament are at risk we shake hands I don't know how many times a day with people

I think that the greatest value of this whole H1N1 event is that national and international communities have a chance to test & hone their emergency response effectiveness  Governments hospital leaders of the medical communities local response units the IT world that tracks and analyzes patterns    It's as though H1N1 is providing a test for the proposals that were set up after SARS 

We all know that pandemics are a biological reality in human as well as other organisms  And H1N1 whatever its origins -- could have been the simple digging up of contaminated soils near a slaughterhouse or military trench -- is both genetically and behaviourally too close to the Spanish flu to have responsibly been ignored  It's a great relief that this illness is not as dire as was expected --

but I think that the public & media are focusing WAY too much on the illness itself and not enough on potential background benefits: in particular the honing of effective international response procedures

for those of you who have decided to get the shot   that is your choice
but please stop laying a guilt trip on those who are not
The H1N1 vaccine DOES NOT stop you from either getting the flu or passing it on to others    it merely helps you fight it off (to some yet undetermined degree)
History shows that a vaccine has never stopped the spread of any virus

This is obviously a comment from another dimension as it is the opposite of all truth 
The vaccine will prevent you from getting sick by allowing your body to eradicate the virus before it can replicate  in doing that it stops the spread of disease to others  get it-if you aren't sick you won't infect others

Since the H1N1 started and people started to post comments on this site its fascinating the change in opinion and change in the debate  If we look back at stories on CBC over the last 2 months and read the comments the % of those spewing anti-vaccine rumors and trying argue that all of us who wanted to protect ourselves and didn't believe in some crazy government-drug company conspiracy have decreased dramatically  Don't get me wrong as it only takes 10 seconds to see a few on this story but overall the debate has changed and there are less 

I was one who was concerned from the beginning particularly cause i work in health care  I seen this start at the Childrens Hospital I work at  I seen one of the first healthy young people die  I tried to reason with some people and ensure all my family and friends that this is not a joke 

This story by CBC highlights a crucial difference with this flu  It hurts those the flu shouldn't  This results in increased ICU admissions increased Emergency Visits increased regular hospital admissions  Plus all those people with minor or moderate comorbidities (Mild Heart Failure Asthma specific lung and live diseases) require more frequent admission  These are considered Medical Admissions  What happens next is the Surgical Services loose their beds to these people  THus the next thing (which has started) is that surgeries are being canceled at increasingly higher rates  These are surgeries people have been waiting months for 

I'm so glad the majority of people are starting to trust the medical profession on this one  There will always be outliers spreading false rumors but its great that people are protecting themselves

Did you ever think that maybe just maybe pro vaccination reports are NOT unbiased reporting    Unbiased reporting give both sides of the facts and question being asked  Something we are not seeing on the news and a reasonable thing to ask when making decisions  I don't think asking questions and wanting straight info is being selfish  I may or may not get the shot I don't know    trying to make an informed decision

CBC seriously? 'ICU admissions up' this is hilarious! You think?! And what were admissions like around this time last year? I'm a nurse and I know flu season  We have crowed ER's every year at this time! Stop scaring people cause I'm stick of cleaning up the frantic mess you media channels have created! Try working my shift for a day you'd be disgusted at the fear you've induced in people! Good job!
-----------------------

Actually flu activity is way up from normal flu which typically starts in late November or December-January  This one started in mid September and really took off in mid October  Also look at Norway  They've had two waves now and both well before the normal seasonal flu  This is a very different annimal in when it occurs and how fast it spreads

Especially given that the web site even says it only reduces symptoms by a 1 3-1 5 days (adult-child)

Technically (s)he's right  The vaccine can absolutely not stop the flu virus from entering your system  The reason for getting a vaccine is to teach your body how to produce the antibodies to fight off the virus  That way when you get the virus for real your body will be able to fight it off quickly enough to prevent you from getting sick from it  I think they were saying on the news that H1N1 vaccines were found to be 80% effective in trials  People who get vaccinated should still be vigilant about hand washing etc  not only for their own health but for everyone else as well  The vaccine will not prevent you from getting the virus on your hands whenshaking hands touching doorknobs etc  and then spreading it around to everything and everyone you touch

-H1N1 kills fewer people than regular flu so we shouldn't be worried about it
-I've gone my whole life without taking vaccines and I'm still healthy

The first statement is true (SO FAR) but misses the point entirely  The people who are dying as a result of H1N1 are often NOT the people who are at risk from regular flu (unless of course you consider perfectly healthy people under age 30 to be at risk)  That simple fact makes H1N1 worth every bit of news coverage 

As for the second statement (about vaccines) that is the most ridiculous thing I've heard  It's like saying Hey I've been carrying around this dinosaur-repelling bracelet all my life and I haven't been eaten by a dinosaur yet! Great logic there  Unfortunately this kind of logic will increase your health risks  Remarkably though more people gave that person a thumbs up than a thumbs down  Go figure 

I end with a rhetorical question for all of you: Who should we listen to - physicians and epidemiologists or some anti-vaccine guy on the internet? It's all well and fine to express an opinion but not all opinions are equally important

I don't necessarily disagree with your comments  There is a risk and H1N1 is a bad bug  As was the Avian Flu       Do you remember the Avian (Bird) Flu?

In 2005 the epidemiogists physicians and specifically the WHO predicted worldwide deaths of up to 150 Million  The actual worldwide death toll? 262 

Use common sense take some precautions  If you're at high risk get an H1N1 vaccination (High Risk means that you are high risk for getting really really sick (ICU admission/Ventilatory Support etc) not high risk for getting the bug) 

The history of the WHO and other experts is that they will always predict the worst case scenario  That's their job 

I must say I am extraordinarily disappointed in the media including the CBC for the way this has been reported  I will not be surprised to hear a year from now that the panic and hysteria driven by the media frenzy is responsible for more fatalities then the virus itself

It's interesting to note that few seem to have taken The Ottawa Hospital to task for deciding to vaccinate the family members of staff when high risk folks and colleagues in neighbouring hospitals anxiously wait their turn    After all who wants to make a similar case for allocating ventilators Tamiflu or  ER services? 
--------------------------------------------

Uh WRONG!    if the families of front-line healthcare workers get sick this means that nurse or doctor will have to stay home and llok after the sick parent spouse or child  This means they will NOT be in hospital looking after sick patients  We want these highly trained individuals IN hospital and providing patient care not at home out of commission  Plus even if immunized healthcare workers may still bring home virus on their clothing to their families  You do NOT want healthcare workers refusing to go to work and look after patients because they feel they will put their famlilies lives at risk  Yes they are in the public service but don't expect them to choose between their job or the health of their families 

I completely agree with vaccinating their families early on  This is NOT the same as providing preferential emergency care like ventilators and it is unethical to try and construe this policy as something like this  Their is NO suggestion that famllies hop lines for ICU care or vital surgeries

Well actually if you were thinking for yourself you would realize that next year the swine flu may be the seasonal flu (or one of them) and your daughters natural immunity may not work as the virus may have mutated somewhat  So next year you may follow the same reasoning but this time the flu may affect her differently  So every year you are putting her at risk  I respect your decision just be aware that this action you are taking will probably not provide immunity in the future  As far as big Pharma and their fear mongering I would put forth that big Pharma already have lots of money and doesn't need to intentionally scare you into taking something bad for you  If this were true I think there are many drugs and diseases out there that they would have tried to capitilize on previous to this one flu  It's actually the non-scientific posters out there that are the scare mongers telling of the horrible side effects when none have been yet seen

at 12:40 PM ETspectre : yes it will be required to have 2 year olds to fight fires because every fire fighter will be taken out by the swine flu  Your comment is ridiculous 

IF the swine flu was a dangerous as your comment implies should we not prioritized the vaccination of our most vulnerable (e g  children)?

If the swine flu is not as dangerous as your comment implies then why do you support cue jumping?

This issue isn't the swine flu the issue is that there are repeated examples of generally upper-class male-dominated groups (e g  hockey players fire fighters board members) being prioritized over others (e g  young children)  And that just seems wrong to me  (Pls note: I am not trying to make this a claim for sexism tho is does smack of that  Rather I think it reveals who is valued in our society  And yes I know that fire fighters are paid a salary that qualifies as upper class)

Yes the provide an important service  This point is indisputable 

But what you propose is highly unlikely and buys in to the hysteria of H1N1 -- the whole fire station falls down??? Unlikely even if a whole shift gets sick there are back ups 

Although fire fighters are important children have been deemed more vulnerable (this has nothing to do with the actual seriousness of H1N1)  They are jumping the cue over young children -- that seems awfully selfish to me

at 12:56 PM ETAccording to a recent post in the forums of GodlikeProductions com the suspect taken into custody was one Joseph Moshe here's an excerpt from the thread as written by HL SHANCKEN



Joseph Moshe (Moshe is the man's middle name) is a bio-scientist  He works (worked?) for a unit within Mossad  He is an Israeli citizen 

The Secret Service was not the agency involved in the surveillance of Moshe at his home in California  This was done by the FBI who had orders to detain him or bring him in 

Moshe did not send a threat to the White House  Rather he communicated that he intended to go public with information he had regarding the flu vaccine that is being prepared by Baxter Labs an Austrian company 

The information is this: The vaccine is being manufactured in Ukraine  It is not a vaccine at all but rather an engineered genetically mutated bio-weapon meant to cause sickness and death  Moshe informed the White House he intended to go public with this information  When he became aware that the FBI was about to detain him he packed some belongings in his car and set out for the Israeli consulate located in close proximity to the federal building where the standoff took place  FBI pursuit kept him from reaching his destination 

Mounted on top of the large black vehicle was a microwave weapon which fried the electronics in Moshe's car as well as any communication devices he had which might have been used to contact the media or others who could help him 

Moshe did not suffer the same effects of the gas and pepper spray that others would have because he had built up an immunity to such weapons as a by-product of his Mossad training 

Moshe was not handcuffed because he was not placed under arrest  After leaving police or FBI

if one examines the data on these diseases (Polio / Smallpox wtc) they were streadily dropping as better diets and hygiene came in  They somewhat spiked when the vaccines were introduced then continued falling at the same rate as before

You said That way when you get the virus for real your body will be able to fight it off quickly enough to prevent you from getting sick from it  so the vaccine does stop people from getting the flu? Which is it? I'll remind you that Had Enough said it would NOT 

Even if it enters a vaccinated persons system the viruses ability to replicate is greatly diminished and therefore decreases transmission 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
We're saying the same thing just using different interpretations of what it means to get the flu  When I say get the flu I mean to say the flu virus is in your system  When you say get the flu you mean to say get sick from the flu  We both agree that the vaccine will not prevent the flu virus from getting into your system but it should stop you from getting sick from the flu once it enters your system

Ever stop to consider they just never named it 100 years ago? or that all these things had different names? It's like the whole autism debate  Some feel that vaccines were what created autism because it came out around the same as vaccination    now the flip side to that brilliant observation is that it was simply named around that time but the condition has been around a lot longer we just never called it autism till then

__________
# Plague of Athens 430 BC  Typhoid fever killed a quarter of the Athenian troops and a quarter of the population over four years  This disease fatally weakened the dominance of Athens but the sheer virulence of the disease prevented its wider spread; i e  it killed off its hosts at a rate faster than they could spread it  The exact cause of the plague was unknown for many years 

# Antonine Plague 165–180  Possibly smallpox brought to the Italian peninsula by soldiers returning from the Near East; it killed a quarter of those infected and up to five million in all  At the height of a second outbreak the Plague of Cyprian (251–266) which may have been the same disease 5000 people a day were said to be dying in Rome 

# Plague of Justinian from 541 to 750 was the first recorded outbreak of the bubonic plague  It started in Egypt and reached Constantinople the following spring killing (according to the Byzantine chronicler Procopius) 10000 a day at its height and perhaps 40% of the city's inhabitants  The plague went on to eliminate a quarter to a half of the human population that it struck throughout the known world  It caused Europe's population to drop by around 50% between 550 and 700 

# Black Death started 1300s  The total number of deaths worldwide is estimated at 75 million people  Eight hundred years after the last outbreak the plague returned to Europe  Starting in Asia the disease reached Mediterranean and western Europe in 1348 (possibly from Italian merchants fleeing fighting in the Crimea) and killed an estimated 20 to 30 million Europeans

The pharmaceutical scientists have no idea what this virus or any flu virus will mutate into  It is virtually impossible to predict what genes will vary as the virus evolves  All the shots do is hope that the few strains they guessed would make the rounds are indeed what everyone is catching 
As a scientist I will not be taking ANY flu vaccines  Especially as I learned they are full of adjuvants such as mercury (which never leaves your system) aluminum (which can cause Alzheimers and cancer)  See ELena28s post as it is pretty accurate 
These latest flu vaccines are nothing more than sad attempts to reassure people that big pharma can fix anything while giving everyone untested bad medicine

I have read so many stories about who is most important and who should get the shot and not once anywhere have they mentioned people with Bronchial illnesses on any list

For those who want it they should be able to get it regardless 
Unfortunately our great country believes that the elderly are more important than anyone else 
I thought all people were equal under the eyes of the law and therefore under the eyes of a lawful government 
Not only must tax-payers support a larger elderly population than has ever been recorded in history we must do it to our detriment  Not expense but detriment 
Others may claim I am anti-elderly  Quite the opposite  I believe that they SHOULD be cared for and respected 
However our society has polarized itself to the extent that a large percentage of families with children in school either do not own a home or are forced to live in tiny apartments/rental homes at outrageous prices 
Does anyone see where this is going? How does this affect the next generation?
Apparently the government's motto on public health is: keep the elderly healthy everyone else can wait 
I guess that's what happens when the average age in Parliament is 55

As a scientist what are you going to do if you ever get bit by a rabid animal? Or cut yourself and a doctor shows up with a tetanus shot? You will be in quite the quandary then won't you? Both those life saving vaccines are full of adjuvants and preservatives containing mercury and aluminum  You state you won't take a flu vaccine especially since they contain those elements 

As a scientist you made a pretty broad statement saying the reasons you won't take a flu vaccine are because of the ingredients    so are those same ingredients just as scary in all situations? Are you willing to risk dying of lockjaw or rabies?

I'm thinking listing mercury and aluminum was a scare tactic because not many people would refuse a series of rabies vaccines after being bit by a dog foaming at the mouth or even refuse a tetanus shot after getting in an accident  Do those same scary anti flu vaccine elements matter in the case of tetanus and rabies? How about a twinrex vaccination for travel south? how about malaria? Is the line drawn at flu vaccines and only flu vaccines?

Initiation of influenza pandemics?

==============

At one point I though you could be trusted for information FP but you've proven you have no interest in the truth  You are picking and choosing lines out of context to propagate some fear mongering 

For those of you interested in the truth related to that link here is the info FP left out:

Human influenza viruses does not replicate efficiently in birds and vice versa due to differences in receptors which bind the viruses  In contrast pigs are uniquely susceptible to infection with human and avian viruses because they possess receptor types present both in humans and avian influenza viruses  As a result pigs have been hypothesized to be the “mixing vessel” hosts for human-avian virus reassortment and there is support for this theory from several studies  See e g  Shu et al  1994 Virology 202:825-33 Scholtissek 1990 Med  Principles Pract  2:65-71 Zhou et al  1999 J  Virol  73:8851-6  This mixing facilitates the generation of novel human influenza virus strains and the initiation of influenza pandemics 

Basically it is an explanation of how pigs can mix both avian and human flu viruses

Estimates suggest that the death rate compares to a moderate year of seasonal influenza said Dr Marc Lipsitch of Harvard University 


It’s mildest in kids  That’s one of the really good pieces of news in this pandemic Lipsitch told a meeting of flu experts being held by the U S  Institute of Medicine 


Barring any changes in the virus I think we can say we are in a category 1 pandemic  This has not become clear until fairly recently 


The Pandemic Severity Index set by the U S  government has five categories of pandemic with a category 1 being comparable to a seasonal flu epidemic 


Seasonal flu has a death rate of less than 0 1 percent — but still manages to kill 250000 to 500000 people globally every year

You tried to mislead people into thinking there was a patent for a pandemic flu virus  Don't try to misrepresent your position now by saying you screwed up the pasting job 

No your quote was specifically chosen to provoke fear and you knew very well that linking the patent was irrelevant because it wouldn't be read by 99% of the antivax crowd but was required because the sentence was that scary  You even quoted 'initiating a pandemic' twice  That is fear mongering 

The patent is for attenuated flu viruses  You already knew that attenuated viruses are needed for vaccines  Finding the patent and quoting speicfic sentences to make it appear you had proof someone patented a pandemic virus is fear mongering

Yes anyone really *should* be surprised given that we've known since at least the time when Louis Pasteur was instrumental in ceasing the rampage of the smallpox virus by using cow smallpox to develop one of the first vaccines that such methods are instrumental in handicapping a virus's ability to infect a host  Do you know how vaccines work? No? Well what a surprise 

A vaccine simply introduces your body's immune system (more specifically your body's T cells) to a particular virus so that it has the advantage - in future encounters - of 'knowing' which antibodies to produce in order to block the virus's receptors 

What you've claimed in nonsensical  How would your body's ability to produce ever more effective antibodies somehow cripple it's ability to fight pathogens?

A vaccine simply introduces your body's immune system (more specifically your body's T cells) to a particular virus so that it has the advantage - in future encounters - of 'knowing' which antibodies to produce in order to block the virus's receptors 


------------------------------


Yeah and that's all good  Right? So tell me this  Why would we need booster shots? And these T cells  What happens when you inject the vaccine? Does it bypass any and create an imbalanced response? (yes   )

Sometimes boosters are required because vaccines are given to populations that don't have immune systems that are as strong as others such as the elderly and children so they need more exposure  Other times it's can be because inactivated or partial virus exposure might only produce a partial immune response like antigen production?

I suppose by bypass any and create an imbalanced response this is what you're referring to but yes that's sort of the idea  Still only a partial response from the immune system is better than no response at all! Vaccines are not the same thing as fully pathogenic viruses and so they don't prompt the same level of response from the immune system  I don't think this means that the response is imbalanced  It just seems that the immune system seems to respond to live attenuated viruses inactivated or subunit viruses less severely than they would respond to live fully pathogenic viruses  It seems to have something to do with Toll-like receptors (TLR) and the signals they send out to the immune system  The immune system is complicated and not fully understood  This is why research into adjuvants is being done  MPL looks like part of a bacterial cell wall and are recognized by one specific TLR which leads to specific signaling  Some TLRs prompt the production of killer T cells helper T cells anitbody inducing T cells or inflammation inducing T cells 

In the end it is still better to have to use vaccines which require booster shots than not to have vaccines at all  Better a vaccine than nothing

No that's also false  I have seen a number of claims that Baxter or MedImmune patented a vaccine for novel H1N1  None of the patents that anyone has pointed to actually mentions novel H1N1  Novel H1N1 is identifiable by its genes and none of the patents I have seen list all the genes of H1N1  If there is a patent (application) for novel H1N1 the please enlighten us all with the patent number so that we can see that patent for itself  As far as I have seen though most people saying that such a patent exists don't have the slightest clue as to what they're talking about

Research is BEING done?? Canada’s pandemic H1N1 vaccine will be available next month and it will contain the squalene based adjuvant AS03  Since this flu vaccine has been fast-tracked can you show that testing has already been done to confirm the safety of this or for that manner any ASO3-adjuvanted vaccine?

Really? Is that your best guess or are you aware of some study that's been done to confirm that this is actually the case? Because it's also possible that the original vaccine imparted no immunity at all and the person became ill from a virus years after being vaccinated against it simply because it took that long for them to be exposed to it  If this is the case then the booster shot will be just as useless as the original vaccine was  Unless of course you’re a vaccine manufacturer and you stand to reap considerable profit from the administration of both

 The generation of these novel viruses in addition to the described antigenic drift variants of H1N1 swine influenza viruses introduce potential veterinary and human public health implications 

These viruses replicate in vivo but demonstrate decreased replication virulence and increased attenuation and therefore are well suited for use in live virus vaccines and pharmaceutical formulations

There are 18 sequences 

The first thing I did was go:

http://www patentlens net/sequence/blast/seqserver html

I enter the patent # and tell it sequences 1 - 18  I click on 18 DNA/RNA sequences and a table of the first ten come up  The first 7 sequences are the longest and thus the most likely to have any biological significance  If I recall correctly the first 10 or so all came up as being most homologous to a previous H3N2 isolate:

Influenza A virus (A/mallard/South Dakota/Sg-00128/2007(H3N2)

Only sequence number 14 which is 44 base pairs ever shows novel H1N1 homology but the matches listed are numerous (because the sequence is short and because novel H1N1 doesn't contain novel gene sequences it contains those genes assembled in a unique combination)  The e-value is 0 12 and there are 22/22 identities (the length of H1N1 genes ranges from 2299 bp in PB1 to 847 bp in NS) so 22 bp is a small sequence  There are at least 100 other sequences that show up with the same e-value which are not H1N1 
http://www patentlens net/sequence/blast/blast html
I use BLAST for my work on a regular basis and I would ignore with results giving e-values above 0 001 as insignificant 

So no there's nothing in that patent linked directly to novel H1N1 except for homology to 22 bp of the 847 bp making up segment 8 (NS) 

Direct evidence of novel H1N1 in a patent would need to fulfill two requirements:
1) sequences with high homology to all gene segments (8 of which are protein codine) found in novel H1N1
2) those segments assembled together into one virion

Go here and paste in segments and it will list patents with the closest homologies:

Thanks  I like that sort of thing 

I'm also reading that Dr  Adrian Gibbs was stating that it had to be made in the lab  He's got the credentials but that was early in the year  He studied the gene sequences of the swine flu virus and argued that it must have been grown in eggs the medium used in vaccine laboratories  I'd like to see some more recent statements from him  He's studied virus genetics for 40 years

at 9:58 AM ETThe CBC reporting is strange  My first comment is in reference to the first article that came out that used the word 'girl' and 'woman' interchangeably  But now that article has been erased replaced with this lengthier article which uses H1N1 and swine flu interchangeably along with the other observations of bad reporting made by other commenters  They should erase comments when they erase a story because it makes the comments irrelevant

at 11:59 AM ETMy sincere condolence to the families that grieve 

Looking at the numbers Nunavut residents represents almost 0 1% of the Canadian population from my calculations  so one maybe two deaths out of 45 is pretty disproportunate don't you think?

On the other hand the health care system in my opinion has done a good job at keeping this entire issue non-alarming  In truth many people are left with a lot of questions and concerns (some outright paranoia) about this virus despite it being downplayed as similar to the regular flu and recommending same treatment - the main messages that I've got is to WASH YOUR HANDS WELL REGULARLY cough/sneeze into your elbow and avoid visiting/spreading the virus 

Personally I haven't got a flu shot for a number of years and have since gotten ill from it maybe twice over this same period  I woke up with a very bad fever last week which I called in sick for and stayed home and slept most of the day  I contacted the hospital to report my condition and they advised that I drink lots of liquids stay home and rest/recover  I asked when I should be concerned and was told that if I'm still not feeling well or the fever persists for 5 or 6 days to go to the hospital 

I felt pretty well the next day and have been fighting off a minor caught the past two-three weeks  I hope everyone is doing their own part in preventing the spread of the virus and taking extra precaution to stay healthy and if you are sick I wish you a speedy recovery 

I don't know if I was (or am) infected was H1N1 or the seasonal flu but I am treating is as the same and hope I get through it alive 

Live is too short - and then you die

Having said that Alberta may be choosing the worst time financially to start this free seasonal flu program this fall - because there are 2 scenarios emerging:

1  swine flu H1N1 will crowd out seasonal flu strains altogether in which case the seasonal flu shot is a waste and useless

2  even if not crowded out the H3N2 seasonal flu has mutated and the vaccine strain that was selected for this fall season won't match the mutated virus rendering the flu shot ineffective

The consequences of NOT being vaccinated against severe illnesses leaves all of us vulnerable  The only reason that diseases like small pox cease to exist is because vaccinating against them destroyed the spread of the disease 

In the case of the flu I can understand why some people would not be vaccinated so long as they are healthy  In the case of life-threatening illnesses such as German Measles people are ridiculous not to be vaccinated and over time severe illnesses like it are going to reappear after being extinct for many years

The place to properly study this issue is at a university library or the central city library for a large city  (At call number 614 47 in the Dewey system ) There you find books both pro- and con- for vaccinations/immunizations  Read the books from the sixties or even the thirties if available; you'll see skepticism about the efficacy of immunizations goes well back to the beginning--including many who doubted that Edward Jenner's cowpox vaccine for smallpox actually had any measurable statistical effect of reducing incidences of smallpox in the population

at 1:46 AM ETThe Road to Serfdom

In making arguments and claims online I think that it's appropriate to be able to offer references when asked  The references don't necessarily need to be linked but I think that if asked to justify an opinion someone should at least be able provide an argument in support of their claim and point to a source of evidence used to support the argument 

Of course nobody is obligated to justify their claims if they don't want to but I think that in an argument it is reasonable 

Simply telling a person to go to a library or google it doesn't provide any information about why one holds a specific opinion  Even if someone provides an explanation - that is gives an argument in support of their opinion - then the factual basis could be disputed (so clearly part of the use of references depends on the subject at hand) 

Disputes over the facts are why I don't like the notion it's good to start in a library even if a logical argument has been made  Some people make a fallacy of presumption and assume that correct sources will only agree with their point of view and wrong sources only disagree with their point of view  When challenged those who make this presumptive fallacy may suggest that if you go to a library and learn to read then you'll see I'm right or will vaguely recommend that google it and educate yourself  In a worst case scenario this would send someone off on a wild goose chase 

Specific references can point directly to the evidence that one used to argue in support of an opinion

Yes Figurehead go figure  People still do go to church  Many of them are even sincere about the underlying message of caring brotherhood they hear there  They enjoy the sense of community they have and the friends they develop there  They often like to express that feeling of community by personal gesture: a hug a handshake a smile and a wave  The Roman Catholic mass has incorporated that gesture as a sign of peace within the service while other denominations leave it to spontaneous expressions of fellowship 

Now if those expressions disappear then all the people who spend their Sunday mornings at Walmart will point out how the churchgoers are all hypocrites not practicing the love and acceptance the gospel recommends  Go figure

Parents please do not send sick children to school  As a teacher I cannot say how many times kids who are way too sick to be at school are there often because both parents work and it's easier to send the child to school than find alternate care  Don't get me wrong - we're a two-working-parent household and it's always a juggling act when one of our kids is sick but it's not fair on the sick child the rest of the class (school) and the school staff  No school I've been in has the resources (bed couch nurse) to care for a child who is too sick to be sitting in class 

I was once told by a parent (when I called her less than a half-hour into the school day because her daughter was throwing up) that her daughter had woken up sick but begged to go to school because she loves it so much  Hello?

I don't want schools closed/delayed in opening but I want to have the ability to send a child home who is in danger of infecting other classmates - with H1N1 or whatever he/she has - without being second-guessed  Daycares do it - if your kid has a fever they're not allowed to attend  Schools should operate the same way

The reason they don't want children to wear gloves and masks isn't because of a fear tactic per se  Or their protection  It's that the government doesn't want children who when grown up a bit and start joining gangs to figure out that if you wear gloves there are no finger prints and if you wear a mask there is difficulty in id ing the member 

Government wants it so they don't get the virus but if you do and go after them they will know who you are  I learnt long ago government lies big time and it's usually to protect them from you the victim  Accept that fact and you will be on your way to seeing right thru them  Wink

at 7:14 PM ETYou are so right motherx3  It's so unfortunate too that so many of us don't have the extended family support close enough to deal with a sick child (although if it's influenza we might not want to expose anyone)!
The thing that bothers me about all of the talk about H1N1 is that so many people still don't understand what the symptoms and consequences of this type of influenza are  We casually talk about the flu but not many of us have really had a case  A week or two of high fever bone aching pain and chills followed by respiratory problems is nothing to take lightly plus this one has intestinal distress as well  Having large numbers of people knocked out like this could be quite disruptive to schools and businesses  Let's hope it doesn't happen

at 8:50 PM ETThe Public Health Agency is living in a dream world  I find it very disturbing that economics is taking a higher priority than the health of students and staffs in schools  Several schools in the US have been forced to close only a week after children have returned to class  What is remarkable about this occurrence????------it is not flu season yet! They have buckled under political pressure to keep schools open despite the fact that they are creating an optimal environment for the transmission of h1n1  The “normal flu” will normally impact approximately 10% of the population each year  The CDC estimates that this will impact about 35-40 % of the population in two years  Just simply do the math  It has nothing to do with whether or not people die  The virus to this point is more serious than the flu (pregnant women younger children and it hits deep lung tissue hard) but it is not fatal in most cases  The numbers of people that will become sick from h1n1 however will be very high due to a lack of immunity  If one child or teacher dies due to transmission in a school the Public Health Agency should be held responsible  School Boards should also be held legally responsible if this happens

Actually I probably did get a bit carried away   I was at another forum discussing gangs and youth in relation to the drug problem  Mix the two with the virus problem and we may have a deeper problem than most suspect 

I wouldn't blame parents for 1 minute if they want to cover their kids mouth and hands and teachers should be encouraging it too  The main reason for covering up is to protect everyone else really from you spreading the virus  

On another note to make it more pallatble for youth    perhaps some entrepeneur out there should come up with designer masks and gloves    you know   make it the in thing!

Think about how much young children share things in a classroom and about how closely they relate to each other? It is completely impossible to contain germs among young children  Also young children would not be out at the mall if school was closed because they would need closer supervision so that problem would be avoided

I'm lucky that my classroom has a sink so it's easy for me to wash my hands or for students to do so at regular intervals  However that only lasts until a pen or a book is picked up  At least I now have another reason to tell students to keep their hands to themselves despite the crowded classroom

Have parents lost all control over their children? Has authority lost all respect for the role of parents?

I hope schools turn away every sick kid that shows up  School is not a refugee camp  It's a place where children go to get an education  If a child is not able to learn due to illness he/she has no business being there  It's high time that schools move away from the provision of social services and focus entirely on education and knowledge I bet we'd even see test score increase if they weren't trying to be social services agencies as opposed to providers of education!

It would also be nice to see all of out education tax dollars spent on education alone and let the health care and social development pay for their share of those student issues 

If schools concerntrated on education alone I bet we'd also have students showing up with a better attitude toward learning as well  This would eliminate the I'm going to Disney Land to be entertained attitude that so many of these kids have toward school these days  It might even help to train parents that schools cannot be nursing kids with the flu back to health when they're too busy educating the ones who are well  Hire a babysitter if your kid's sick and you can't stay home

I guess it depends on your family doctor like everything else  But in your specific story there is no reason for a family physician to push vaccines on you  They do not get paid per vaccination they get paid per visit regardless of the reason you are there  Be that inject you with poison or talk to you about your last fishing trip

at 12:41 PM ETI'm sure the epidemiologist from McGill Dr  Timothy Brewer mentioned that there was some reasoning behind the Ministry of Health's decision to place seniors lower on the vaccination priority list - was this information simply ignored for the sake of making the article more inflammatory (pardon the pun   )?

Studies have shown that people born before 1950 are more likely to have some immunity against H1N1 as they have been exposed to viruses in the past that share some molecular similarities to today's strain  While these pre-existing antibodies do not by any means convey total immunity against H1N1 along with their decreased exposure to the virus (most are no longer in the workforce and come into contact with less strangers throughout the day) seniors are far less likely to be infected by this virus  Data from the states have shown the following age distribution of those infected by this virus:
* 0 to 4 years — 22 9%
* 5 to 24 years — 26 7%
* 25 to 49 years — 6 97%
* 50 to 64 years — 3 9%
* ?65 years — 1 3%

In mass vaccination programs officials have the duty of doing the most good with the limited resources they have  They acknowledge that the illness has the potential to be more serious in seniors but from the stats they are working with this will be a far less likely occurrence  With regards to differentiating between seniors with chronic medical conditions and those without this simply isn't possible since the vast majority of seniors suffer from some form of chronic illness (diabetes hypertension COPD etc) 

Hopefully journalists will start doing more research as opposed to writing one-sided articles that pit people against each other

wow    yet here we are facing no school closures with no plans of shutting schools down  Insane  The decision not to close schools down here is 100% financial  They would much rather profit from a possibly useless/dangerous vaccine than lose money closing schools that is a guarantees preventitive measure of up to 50% effectiveness with no medical side effects  lol  All classes could have easily been put up on school websites for home learning those without computers could have done it the old fashioned way and went in to pick them up or mailing out    They had the entire summer to prepare for this and make logical steps for health safety and did nothing  (save make 1 million brochures on how to put soap on your hands which I am certain every high school child will pin it up right beside their fav band picture and follow it to the letter

at 11:48 AM ETSo schools in Canada will remain open until the outbreak is severe enough to warrant closing (usually 20 to 30 percent of students sick) then we'll close  According to WHO that is too late  Must act quickly to prevents spread yet we will wait until so many are infected that it won't make a difference  Then each of those students will go home and spread it to their families to send it to workplaces and other schools 

I don't pretend to have all the answers but I am sure that very soon there will be a lot of sick Canadians  It's the first week of school and students are missing time already

So out of a school of 1000 if 10 are sick they want to close schools 

Next question how do they expect to know if those ten have swine flu or the regular flu since they do not do lab work to diagnosis it?

I suspect on most days more then 10 kids would be absent I think this is getting rather ridiculous

at 9:40 PM ETI think the WHO message is a decent start but not an entire recommendation 

First step would be to keep your children home if they are ill at all  Forcing someone else to become ill because you are too cheap or thoughtless to lose a days work is criminal and would be a valid civil suit at the very least 

Second step if a school does receive an ill child they should first segregate that child to prevent the spread of their illness  In cases of pandemic illness the school should also be locked down and those present should not be permitted to leave until they have be proven to have not been infected 

Third step would be to bring criminal charges against the parents who knowingly sent their sick children to school knowing they could pass their illness on through the other children and out into the community  This should be the normal course of action including sending your child to school when they have ANY of the common childhood illnesses that are transferable 

Indeed a child who is immunocompromised should not be prevented from receiving an education simply because some selfish person pretending to be a parent is willing to risk someone elses life or well-being so they can earn a days pay 

As essential as an income is in our capitalistic society it's cheaper to lose a days pay than to treat someone who has become ill because of another persons negligence

Shame on any one of us who think our right to earn an income is paramount to the wellfare of our children and the health of our entire nation

Doctors nurses EMT's hospital staff members and police and emergency (firemen) should be first in line and urged to be vaccinated 

Soap and water and common sense will prevent most of the spread but in crowded places like schools a pro-active approach by the staff is needed to make sure that kids stay washed up and avoid unneccessary contact with their faces

at 11:38 AM ETA few points for the 'it's just another flu' crowd 

- It's a mild flu for the healthy but is killing people who would not have succumbed to seasonal flu  For example significant proportion of the deaths are young people with asthma 
- Resistance is low this means the infection rate will be substantially higher  It will also spread faster  There is an enormous societal impact if 20 to 30 per cent of the population all get sick at the same time  Further even if the mortality rate is the same as seasonal flu if the infection rate is higher then total number of deaths will be higher 
- At this moment the total number of flu cases resembles seasonal flu except that seasonal flu peaks mid winter  The case count is still climbing 

None of this is to say we should be panicking but we should be prudent  For example my wife and I both are currently recovering from the flu  I stayed out of my kids school on opening day because I did not know if I was still contagious or not 

As for closing the schools I think it would only work if the kids all stayed home  The reality is that closing a school means those kids end up in a day care or the malls or congregated somewhere else spreading the disease anyways  While we need to take precautions to mitigate this flu we have to accept the fact that it's here spreading and a lot of us are going to get it 

(To the guy who thought we should be more worried about Ebola: it kills way to fast to spread  There have been less than 2000 deaths since 1976)

The regular flu kills 40-50000 people annually 
We do not need to worry about the swine flu  One should be more concerned about the coming vaccination regime that the WHO has planned for us 
************************
The regular flu kills far more than that 35-40000 in the US alone about 4000 in Canada  Extrapolated that means about 6-700000 world-wide

at 1:01 PM ETOK there is a new virus which we are told has a 1% mortality rate  So if every Canadian was infected that would be 300000 ish people perishing 

We are also told that most people will experience mild symptoms surprisingly identical to that of H3N5 the common flu  Also surprising is that H1N1 has the same symptoms as a common cold which is still a virus just weaker than the flu 

The medical community is not testing for H1N1 when people go to the doctor  Therefore any flu like symptom will be attributed to H1N1 regardless if it is or not 

Our federal government is not tracking individual cases anymore just looking for trends if it spreads  Stats Canada has nothing on its website that is monitoring the spread of flu in Canada  You can find out about BMI for age and gender if you require it though 

Although no order has come down for mandatory vaccinations I do know that childhood vaccinations for a myriad of diseases MMR etc are a requirement for entering a public school 

Although there is no legal requirement to be vaccinated employers can demand a vaccination as a condition of employment  Remember you have to sign up to all the benefits life dental medical as a condition of employment  Unless you can prove other insurance by naming the company and your account number you are bound to the one the company is using  This is a condition of employment yet there is no legal edict that demands you have these 

The nature of a pandemic is a pathogen enters an area by means of an individual or group spreads throughout the community peaks and then wanes  It does not wait for flu season to hit  This makes it way to convenient to lump common flu and colds into the pandemic numbers

how difficult could it possibly be to put some sort of antibacterial hand cream in the entrance of each classroom and urge each student to use when enterting the school and when entering each class 

any answers ?????

i know my moms a highschool science teacher and she urges her students to use the hand gel when they enter and exit her class each day and they are all okay with doing so as it's SIMPLE and MAKES SENSE

So is there any overlooking person putting this EASY plan into action ???
Anyone here have that kinda power I think it would help 

===========================

You can't just go into a school daycare university college etc and mount a hand sanitizer on the wall  There are rules and regulations that need to be followed and there are specific people that are allowed to mount these things  Could take years  The federal government needs to mandate hand sanitizers at all public entrances and exits and give them 30 days to install or be shut down

To clarify a few things for you: Testing is still occurring just not every suspected case as they were initially  The results of the cases tested are the guidance for how many of the reported flu cases are H1N1  Currently close to 100 per cent of the tested cases are H1N1  That fact combined with the fact that seasonal flu is normally at the bottom of it's cycle at this time of year leads to conclusion that if you have the flu right now it's probably H1N1 

Cold and flu symptoms do overlap however it's generally easy to tell the two apart  Colds don't give you fever aches or extreme fatigue flus do  It's highly unlikely that common cold cases are being lumped into the flu cases 

As for mandatory vaccinations I've yet to even hear of an employer requiring them yet  Unless you have some actual facts on the issue all you're doing is spreading FUD*

at 7:59 PM ETTwo seniors with underlying conditions died in London ON  Also a 2 month old baby  What are the national stats on deaths   ages underlying conditions other variables?
I believe children and pregnant mothers and frontline health care workers should go to the head of the queue  But I fear this pandemic is rapidly becomming the QUEUE FLU! And across this country various groups are finding ways to get to the head of the queue 
This has been managed very badly at every level of government and in some health care authorities  The children pregnant mothers and health care workers should have been targeted from day one  Perhaps that job would be nearly completed by now  Then maybe just maybe people at high risk including people over 65 could get noticed instead of being ignored 
Getting back to those mortality statistics from what I have samples on this site it seems that deaths are occuring across all demographic groups  It also seems that older people who have died have had underlying conditions that would enable the transition to the pneumonia that kills them 
What is perplexing about the QUEUE FLU is that there seems to be no sense of urgency by governments  It seems to be sufficient to say that we are so much ahead of other industrial countries  Could that be a lie? Where is the independantly verifiable evidence? Instead of spouting platitudes actually solve problems  These flu pandemics are very serious killers  I was teaching in central Africa during the 1968-69 flu pandemic  One Monday morning I was talking to an employee and he casually mentioned that his three young children had died on the Saturday within hours of each other  That is why these global pandemics are taken seriously

To those blaming people for not dispensing the vaccine to these individuals however please take a moment to consider:

The vaccine is not offered to children under 6 months because it hasn't been properly tested in this age category  Even children under 10 are only given a half-dose at a time and it's now thought that will be sufficient for their little bodies 

Seniors are not a priority for the vaccine because - in general - seniors seem to have some kind of immunity to the disease these individuals are apparent exceptions  As seniors - in general - seem to have immunity it is those age groups which seem to - again in general - be most adversely affected which are getting first priority access to the vaccine 

Young children people under 40 with chronic illness (particularly heart lung immunity issues etc ) seem - in general - to be most affected by H1N1  There are exceptions and these seniors seem to be part of that unfortunate group 

Again: Deepest condolences to the families

at 8:43 PM ETI have composed a long letter to the current Federal Health Minister who I suspect will be soon 'retired' from her position given all the visible signs of poor management of this entire exercise in getting H1N1 to the Canadian public both high risk and the millions of the rest of us 

Part of my letter is about the fact that someone involved with ordering H1N1 vaccine without any sensible thoughts decided that a Thimerasol free H1N1 vaccine isn't necessary in Canada for anyone with a true allergy to Thimerasol  I have such an allergy and do receive a Thimerasol free regular flu vaccine each year  I live in Western Canada  This year my contact person at the Health Department a senior Health Officer informed me that I would not be able to have an H1N1 vaccine that is Thimerasol free as it won't be available anywhere in Canada 

I feel this is a huge discriminatory decision for those of us with this allergy  I even was told today after calling Ottawa's Minister of Health's office to go ahead and just have the regular H1N1 because there is only a tiny amount of Thimerasol in the vaccine ' Actually I know how much and it is 5 times the amount that is in the regular flu vaccine! So even the Health Minister's office is giving out very incorrect information which was from a non-medical staff person there  Had I taken that information as correct I would have had a worse reaction to the H1N1 vaccine than I did to my first and only regular flu vaccine that contained Thimerasol of which I was unaware at the time 

I am currently trying to arrange an appointment for my H1N1 vaccine in Washington State as the U S  does have Thimerasol free injectable and nasal spray H1N1 vaccine  Isn't this great we in Canada are supposed to have health care for all 

Guess not!

The reason infants under 6 months are not being vaccinated are because they don't know if the vaccine is safe for infants under 6 months  The mothers of children that age are a priority for vaccination and it is believed the mother will pass on the immunity from her breast milk  As for the seniors it is believed that seniors already have some immunity from this strain as they have immunity  Of course this is what is believed but what is believed today isn't necessarily what will be true tomorrow  This is health science and science is based on hypothesis and gathering information and that information will be changing everyday  This story changes that

Someone I l know who just hit 30 was recently admitted to the hospital with H1N1 related pnuemonia because he was not given the opportunity to be vaccinated   apparently he's not as important as the other high risk people in the public even though the H1N1 mortality rate in this age group sits at approximately 25% of all H1N1 related deaths!

What is it going to take for the government to do something about this mess? Is it going to take the death of one the PMs own family (or another high ranking official)   or did they somehow already get vaccinated like the pro athletes?

I fully support people having the right to choose not to vaccinate however if the WHO the government and the media want to cause a public panic then the least the government can do is to be on the ball with the vaccine program

Please  check the Public Health Agency of Canada website 
There is *no* seasonal influenza A in circulation right now  For one thing it's several weeks before the onset of the regular flu season  In addition 99 7% of all positive influenza A swabs are coming back as H1N1 when cultured  The flu-A test is being used in hospitals because it's quick and inexpensive  Only the swabs of those with severe symptoms are being sent for further testing just to confirm that is continues to be H1N1  If someone has a positive flu-A test right now it's safe to assume it's swine flu

at 7:45 AM ETI live in London so let me tell you some things

First off the reason they are jumping so fast to call it H1N1 without a conclusive test is because ALL influenza cases in London hospitals so far that have been tested ALL came back to be H1N1 so far it is the ONLY flu circulating in London 

I can't believe this article left that out !

This article also failed to mention that one of the seniors was in the hospital for something else and actually caught H1N1 in the hospital 

It's pretty scary when people in your own city start dying to H1N1 it sure puts things into perpective it's not about stats or numbers its about it being here and who knows what will happen to who and who will get it  It's here      it's here and there is no denying that

Boy can I relate there  I once caught Bell's Palsy while recovering after having had my tonsils removed  Luckily I have only a very small residual effect but your statement highlights a serious problem otherwise  A year after my Bell's Palsy 'experience' I went back to the hospital to deliver my third baby  A day later I developed a very serious chest infection and nearly had to be put into ICU 

Unfortunately because hospitals tend to be full of sick people it's really the best place to get sick if you're otherwise healthy and in the hospital for a routine procedure  It's like that in every hospital  Doctor's offices aren't much different 

My eldest son lives in London with his step-mother and eleven year old step-sister  I only hope they're doing well 

My heart gos out to those surviving family members who now must bury their loved ones  What a horrifying and crushing thing to undergo

I feel they should change the way they are doing the vaccines or rethink about them--shouldn't there be equal rights?

at 9:58 AM ETAs per the story The two seniors who died had a number of underlying health conditions the health unit said 

Seniors with underlying health problems are excluded frpm currently receiving the H1N1 flu shot 

Had they been 64 years old they would have qualified for the shot  At age 65     no 

This poses a difficult question  It seems pretty obvious that seniors with underlying health problems are at just a significant risk as younger peope with underlying health problems 

So why are they being excluded?

Initially every death was attributed to 'underlying health issues' which ended up covering almost every known ailment   now they don't use that as a reason as much   so they still don't know why/what causes death from H1N1 in those that don't make it

3fairies sorry to hear that you are all infected and hope you are all better soon 

From the material I have seen so far (including ON ministry of health website regional websites and public health agency of Canada) Household contacts and care providers of persons at high risk who cannot be immunized or may not respond to vaccines   - which means if you live with a child under 6 months that cannot be vaccinated you (and the others in your home that live with the infant) are part of the priority group 

Here is a link to the Q&A page for Public Health Agency of Canada

http://www phac-aspc gc ca/alert-alerte/h1n1/faq_rg_h1n1-eng php#vac

Household contacts and care providers of persons at high risk who cannot be immunized or may not respond to vaccines: Some high-risk groups like children under six months and those with weakened immune systems cannot be immunized so those around them should be immunized to reduce the risk of spreading the virus to these groups

i think this is repeated flu that we have had in the past 
h1n1 is just a new fancy flu bug name for the swine flu 

and also it's a known fact that flu season kills every year  and a known is also all people who die from phnemonia get locked into that group 

that young hockey player that recently died was 13 his brother looks like about 10 how come his brother or the rest of his family didn't get it  it seems our government is lumping all illnesses into this swine flu illnesses 

i guess it looks better 

my advice to all of you is stay away from hospitals places where there are large crowds wash your hands  stay away from kids as much as possible kids are the biggest carriers of what ever that lurks out there

Read the story completely 

My condolences to the families  It's wonderful for some of us to have the luxury of debating whether to have the shot or not while people who are high risk run the risk of becoming seriously ill or dying  I hope those that have made the decision not to have the shot remain well and don't pass this along

The reason that seniors can fight this is likely due to the fact that their immune systems have developed  The immune systems developed because they grew up in a time when there were not so many vacines injected so they became stronger  Do some research people don't panic  Unfortunately people that are ill have weaker immune systems it has always been that way and always will  Unfortunately that is life  I don't understand why the media is blowing this out of proportion it is LIKELY that any of us could pass away today from any number of things

No     I don't agree   I usually get the Flu shot and no one is going to dangle that in front of my face   That sounds like blackmail to me  
I will ask my Dr  for the flu shot    maybe but I am NOT taking this newly-concocted Swine flu shot   This is seriously becoming a screwed up plan to    what ? depopulate ?

You know what I find very strange ? Not once has the Gov't mentioned anything about how many people are going to get this Flu from playing VLT machines at the Casino's and the Bars  They have got to be the dirtiest things besides money and public washrooms   You have to hunt around the Casino's for wipes for your hands and they're not even sanitized ones   The Bars don't even have them They used to be in plain sight now they are hidden   Guess it was cutting into the profits too much  
Why haven't they mentioned this ? Because they simply don't want people to stop gambling   I  for one  will not be visiting the Casino's until this thing is over    if it ever is

We are seeing alot of H1N1 patients right now in Manitoba but all the cases I have seen this past week have mild symptoms  As we go into October and the colder weather things will start to ramp up and we will really see how this all plays out  I suggest you do not even pay attention to the confirmed H1N1 case numbers that the Health Dept will announce because they are not a true respresentation of actual infection rates 

* Wash Your Hands Every Hour
* Cough or Sneeze Into Your Sleeve

These are NOT symptoms of H1N1:
1 - Diarrhea (NOT)
2 - Nausea (NOT)
3 - Vomiting (NOT)

These ARE symptoms of H1N1:
1 - Sore Throat
2 - Fever
3 - Being Tired
4 - Body Aches
5 - Mild Cough

* If you develop these H1N1 symptoms treat your symptoms with over the counter products like Tylenol Advil etc  Stay home get lot's of rest and see a Physician if:

1 - you become VERY lethargic and/or
2 - have difficulty breathing and/or
3 - have a high fever that persists and cannot be brought down

The H1N1 Virus has proven to push out the regular Influenza Virus and thus H1N1 will be the dominant Respiratory Virus that will be spread in Manitoba from Oct - Jan  The H1N1 Vaccine will NOT be available in Canada until the end of November so don't count on it to protect you 

Yes this Respiratory Virus is much worse than usual but still you need to stay calm and not overwhelm our healthcare system with panic  We need our doctors and nurses to be free to see the patients that develop SEVERE symptoms

at 7:24 AM ETKettner also gave his thoughts on the preliminary draft of an unpublished study that offers an association between prior flu shots and the H1N1 pandemic  The study suggests those who received a flu shot last fall are twice as likely to contract the H1N1 virus

Just A Thought: the actual group of people that received the traditional flu shot LAST YEAR have a higher % of risk factors than the population at large ( chronic disease etc ) and that is the very reason they received the traditional flu shot LAST YEAR in the first place 

Fast forward 9 months and people with risk factors such as ( chronic disease etc ) are more likely to have severe H1N1 infections than the rest of the population 

So the fact that the % people testing positive for the H1N1 Virus is a result that this at risk group was more likely to have received the traditional flu shot LAST YEAR because of their risk factors 

It has NOTHING to do with the fact that the traditional flu vaccine administered last year some how has some sort of cause relationship with your risk of getting H1N1 this fall  Just like the Aboriginal peoples genetics has NO cause relationship that has resulted in this population having a higher rate of H1N1 infection rates  Aboriginals peoples have a higher H1N1 infection rate because this group has a higher % of their people:
1 - living in crowded housing
2 - poorly ventilated housing
3 - with underlying chronic disease
4 - less access to running water
5 - less access to physicians that can treat the infection early

PS: I forgot to mention that you should make sure to NOT touch your eyes nose or mouth as this will dramatically reduce your chance of transferring the virus from your hands into your respiratory system

I've been practically forced to do research on the subject as I was diagnosed with Aspergers an ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) about 3 months ago now  This was about my 29th Birthday when this happened 

The point of my saying this is that Autism is not a bad disease  I've managed to live a pretty normal life without ever having a diagnosis  There were difficulties and looking back now I can easily understand how some of these difficulties were caused but I have not suffered  I struggle at times to communicate in a way that others are going to understand but that didn't keep me from completing a University education being active in competitive sports or having meaningful relationships 

The biggest issue with this vaccine is not the mercury (which BTW is ethylmercury which doesn't bioaccumulate anyway) 
It's the addition of the adjuvant

There are other options to the mercury-containing Thimerosal preservative they use in the vaccine  Read the Health Canada website about that and they won't give vaccines with mercury (apparently) to children 6 months and under 

Why doesn't that happen with everyone? Well it increases the cost! You're life just isn't worth that much or so the government thinks I guess 

How much would it increase the cost to use a non-mercury containing preservative? Maybe a buck? Ask me if I'd pay the extra buck out of my own pocket not to have that garbage in it  Not a problem

Canada is protecting the drugmaker of swine flu vaccine from lawsuits over potential side effects Canada’s top doctor has confirmed 
Dr  David Butler-Jones told a media teleconference Wednesday that Canada will shield GalxoSmithKline in the unlikely event there are problems with the vaccine but it will not shield health practitioners who make mistakes in administering the shot 
“We’re not obviously anticipating problems with it but indemnification for a vaccine is important if someone does malpractice basically injects someone the wrong way or causes harm because of their practice” he said

at 8:15 PM ETWow and here I have been anything but pro Alberta for so long  Here they are taking a pragmatic approach to flu vaccines as opposed to so many other provinces running around like chicken little 
This whole idea about putting off the now called seasonal flu vaccination until January is baloney  It's nothing more than a calculated cost savings in BC anyway 
On one hand the experts say those born before 1957 have a better chance of dealing with H1N1 than other folks in their 40s 
But it is the older folks that need the protection from the 'seasonal flu' but can't get until January  Unless they have a prescription 
This is the worst form of politicing in medicine  Every new theory brings about a knee jerk reaction from the bean counters 
Fact is by the time the H1N1 vaccine is widely available the wide spread infection will be on the wane and the flu will have run its course 
Except of course for that old 'seasonal' nemisise that will be just gaining momentum because of course nobodies been vaccinated 
I expect we are all victims of the old Chinese curse' 'may you live in interesting times'

at 9:00 PM ETGood on Alberta  This is the first province that basically has got it right  They obviously concluded the recent study was half baked and made no sense  Further they realize it is unethical to withhold a vaccine that could save hundreds of lives it it gets out earlier 

The only part I would quibble with is the plan to suspend the seasonal flu when the swine flu vaccine becomes available just due to time  This does not make sense  I am diabetic and inject daily  It is a 20 second or so procedure  A flu shot visit typically takes 10 minutes or more  They have to identify you ask if you are allergic to anything (eggs) and then go over all the remotely possible side effects  This is in addition to the usual chit chat to make the person comfortable  So if you have both vaccines in your hand what is the real difference in time commitment when you compare 10 minutes to 10 minutes plus 20 seconds for an additional shot  And this does not consider the person's time to get to the appointment and back  I suspect on average it is an hour or more for the person getting vaccinated  A two visit program will cost each person an extra hour and worse still they may not bother to do two trips 

So they have a bit of time left and I would hope they review the option to give two shots at the same time  It makes the most sense

at 9:09 PM ETI am 8 weeks pregnant and I will not be getting any flu shot  My reasons?? First of all Canada is NOT offering a Thimersol free flu vaccine  Thimersol contains mercury and would you subject an unborn child to this? So if I received the H1N1 vaccine and the regular flu vaccine that doubles the amount of mercury my unborn child is exposed to  Are there any studies to prove that it will not harm my child? No  In the U S  they have thimersol free vaccines and encourage prognant women to get these  But not here in Canada- there is no option 

Also all the flu vaccines will contain an additive to boost the immune system so the vaccine is more productive  Again there are no studies of the side effects on pregnant women and children two of the groups that are being encouraged to get the vaccine 

If you cannot prove to me these two additives are safe I refuse to get the vaccine  Some doctors and pediatricians encourage their patients NOT to get the vaccine  They say this is in no way a pandemic  Why put this crap into your body without proper proof that it is safe? If you cannot prove this to me I do not want to find out down the road that it was harmful and my baby has some sort of deffect or dies because of this  How many times does the government look back at decisions they've made and say Oops

~~~~~~~~~~
Canada has purchased unadjuvanted H1N1 vaccine for pregnant women because there are no studies on the adjuvant's effect on pregnant women  They say they have purchased unadjuvanted vaccine for pregnant women I would certainly ask to see the ingredients before being jabbed though  Just to make sure 

Your concern over the mercury content is valid  I understand that mercury has been removed from childhood vaccines but not seasonal flu shots and the H1N1 vaccine will contain mercury  I don't believe there is any 'safe' amount of it that can and will be injected directly into muscular tissue in anyone 

I don't get flu shots and will not get the H1N1 jab either

Also with all the H1N1 propaganda going on perhaps the results reflect more the public fear of an outbreak or searching the web for honest information rather than actual symptoms being felt by individuals  I can see this being used as a reporting tool on effective public broadcasting of a message  I suppose it would be a good tool for this purpose

Too little too late if you have flu like symptoms for the at risk people in your family  These are the families who would have benefited from home educating their children  You still have a teacher you can reach during the day you are still learning the provincial curriculum and it is still overseen by a school board  The only difference is that the student is learning from home through provincially approved text books and writing provincially approved tests 

This may be a safer alternative than sending at risk children to school and hoping they are safe

at 8:55 AM ETI was SURE that the CBC reported it  I've looked for the article but can not find it 

When the question arose sometime last summer that shouldn't we keep the schools closed this year to help prevent the flu from spreading? that there was a response saying something like    no need to keep the schools closed however if an individual school is showing an absentee rate of about 10% then we will definitely close the school   

They say that this is a new or novel flu virus but then they say that this flu is related to the Spanish flu that went around the world the first time in 1917-1918 and continued with its rounds until about 1957 so people born before that time do not have to be immunized against this flu 

They said that the onset of a novel flu would show the mortality and the groups that were in the most danger would be identified meaning that the first wave often shows the highest death rate  Then we were told that the rates would increase in the second wave because of more people being infected  (I'm sure rates aren't supposed to increase just the numbers   ?)

The governments own discrepancies are giving me pause    they say one thing but do another  I have always stayed away from people like that and to have my own government being the same way    ?

What is really going on? I just don't trust anything right now  Something just isn't right with this whole situation  And I can't put my finger on it

Have you read what else is available on the sites you get that education? You are not permitted to say you got an education on a topic when naturalnews or whale to or fluscam are your sources  These sites are not interesting in your wellbeing or even factual content 

If you had a child with failing kidneys would you get the advice from a reporter an herbalist or a specialist in child related kidney disorders? How about if your basement foundation is leaking? Do you go see an accountant or a foundation specialist? For the most part those opposed to the vaccine are selling mega vitamins or snakeoil in some form  At least read the information provided by the specialists in viral biology before believing that vitamin D and garlic will save your life  They had all kinds of milk sunshine and garlic in 1918 but that didn't help the 1/3 of the planet that got sick and the 50 million(ish) that died '

Westlock just north of Edmonton has confirmed cases in schools:

http://www westlocknews com/news/2009/1020/news1 htm

H1N1 confirmed at area schools
At least five students have contracted H1N1
Several confirmed cases of the H1N1 influenza virus have surfaced at Westlock and area schools 

Westlock Elementary School sent out a letter on Thursday informing parents of four confirmed cases of H1N1 influenza among the students 

WES principal Terry Anderson said they sent out the notice to let everyone know what was going on at the school and to dispel some of the rumours circulating around the community 

   

At WES Anderson said they had just over 15 per cent of the students absent from the school mid-week 

However that number stabilized to about 11 5 per cent (60 students) by Friday he indicated 

At Dapp School absenteeism rose above 10 per cent last week 

Some of that was absolutely due to seasonal influenza she said

However they were NOT tested for H1N1 so my questions are could they have had H1N1? Was it another type of flu? What is the point of being inmunized if you have already been exposed to the virus? What are the dangers of being imunized if you have already had H1N1?
All of the information you can get about H1N1 tells you to stay home get imunized and you could get very sick and die  The symptoms are all the same as seasonal flu unless tested for H1N1 how can people keep saying that it is H1N1  We need actual facts and usefull advice DOCTORS when a patient comes in could you actually run tests that confirm what is wrong before simply saying oh it's H1N1 go home and let them know if there is any point standing in a lineup 3 hours long to be imunized for something they have already been exposed to

I am not all into the theorist garbage I also think the shot will have more of a placebo effect than an actual effect    but dang ppl chill out  your odds of you and/or your loved ones dying from this are very very VERY minor  Your drive to get the shot is more dangerous statistically speaking  look it up

at 2:33 PM ETI'm curious as to why this vaccine wasn't given out in a decentralized manner - i e  at doctors' offices schools and workplaces from the get-go  Why did this week have to be so chaotic with huge crowds lineups and people being turned away from a few central clinics?

I guess the simple answer might be If it weren't for the media frenzy surrounding certain highly publicized news reports this week then there wouldn't have been huge lineups at those high priority clinics this week 

But let's assume that there was no media frenzy and that people weren't any more fearful of getting sick with this strain of flu vs  the regular seasonal flu  Are there not tens of thousands of families with children between 6 mts and 5 yrs of age pregnant women and people with underlying medical conditions? How could only a dozen or so clinics that are open for 8 hours be sufficient in getting these people immunized - as health officials say they should be - without huge lineups and chaos?

Wouldn't it have been more efficient to give out this vaccine in a decentralized manner? Perhaps there's some logistical reason that hasn't been explained in the media  I honestly don't know   are there any nurses or health care officials who read these forums who have experience in such matters and can shed some light on this?

at 2:38 PM ETNow that this has become a problem immunization clinics should go directly to those most at risk -- children; closely followed by university age young people  The very young should be allowed to go to the school clinics 
I think a large dose of realism must be injected into this bureaucratic fiasco  For most older adults this has proven not to be a hugely dangerous flu virus and that is even more true for people over 65 who don't have chronic illness that the flu would exacerbate 
When possible seriously affected adults should see their doctor who will know exactly how many doses available to them on a daily basis 
I was planning to go to a Monday clinic that may now be cancelled  I think it should be cancelled  The focus should be on those most in danger -- the young and older people very seriously at risk 
Lets add a dose of dignity to this immunization program something our governments seemed incapable of doing and wait until the young people are vaccinated and then complain as much as we want  I think that's dignified and a bit of criticsm at the same time!

All these mass clinics should have been mass distribution centers for physicians and pharmacists (400 of whom can administer vaccine in AB alone) to pick themselves be immunized and pick up a few thousand doses  That would have been exceedingly more effficient - I would have thought nearly anyone with even half a wit could see that - but I'd be wrong of course 

Let's see    pregnant and elderly and those with young children waiting in 3-6 hour long lineups with no where to sit or the same ppl waiting maybe an hour or so in a doctors office waiting room    hmmmm?

at 2:45 PM ETI agree with gottabkd  Doing the process in a more decentralized manner may have been useful but there are some definite problems  I'm a doctor and so from the health care point of view one of the reasons is definitely efficiency - it takes longer to get the appropriate number of vaccine doses to each and every doctor's office and school and to make sure that the doses keep coming than to do that in a few central clinics 

Just think of the organizational difficulties inherent in that especially when your supply isn't steady 

So if you're trying to roll out the vaccine quickly to high risk groups it makes more sense to run things out of centralized clinics both in terms of the public knowing where to go and managing supply and demand 

Having said that my understanding is that doctor's offices are in fact going to be getting the vaccine - I work in a hospital but my family doctor said that she is going to be receiving the vaccine shortly and will start to administer it from her clinic

at 2:47 PM ETSome suggestions based on my experience on Monday getting the H1N1 vaccine:

1  Train Licensed Practical Nurses to give the vaccine  I'm sure a 2 hour course will be lots of time 
2  Open more clinics
3  Interview people in line (does not need a nurse) and verify they are aware of the risks -- don't take up the nurse's time doing this 
4  Give clipboards to those in line to fill their form out  No need to do this at a desk 
5  Don't provide chairs for the able bodied being vaccinated to sit and chat with the nurse  Get to the nurse with your sleeve rolled up get the shot and keep walking to the 15 minute post vaccine room  Remember how it was done when you were a kid in school?
6  Have a volunteer or non nurse record the lot number of the vaccine on the form 
7  Enlist the medical technicians that take blood samples at labs to give shots  They may not be able to do it from the labs but I suspect many would be happy to work overtime at a far lower cost than using doctors 
8  Get vaccine clinics set up in schools and universities

These charges which were filed yesterday could not come at a more inopportune moment for the government and health specialists  The vaccination campaign got underway last Tuesday in a climate of national skepticism as to the vaccine’s safety and efficiency and this news will surely boost the morale of the increasing number of anti-vaccine lobbyists who are beginning to organize their resistance to any attempt to vaccinate the population against H1N1 
Nine inhabitants of the Isére region of France are cited as joint plaintiffs in the case including a health sector worker a teacher and a radio talk show host  They met each other at various public meetings held to denounce the vaccine’s alleged health risks 
“The aim is to put a stop to what we consider to be an act of poisoning” according to Joseph  “The interest of this action is that people in France now have a means by which to express their concern as citizens by saying publicly “We are aware that the vaccination campaign is a swindle ”
Similar court actions are planned in other areas of the Isére as well as in Paris Pau and Nantes and several hundred vaccine opponents are beginning to organize themselves on the internet with a view to filing class action charges

There are some great ideas in your post but there are also a few that could not be implemented 
1) An RN needs a special course to administer vaccines so LPNs would need an extended course and I'm unsure if vaccine administration is in their scope of practice  Ditto on getting medical technicians to do it - people who draw blood phlebotomists are trained to do that not administer vaccines 
2) The interviewing and lot # documentation needs to be performed by the person administering the vaccine (i e  the Nurse Physician or Pharmacist) because of the 7 rights of medication administration - (patient dose route concentration documentation reason and time) - they are ALL the primary responsibility of the person administering for a good reason  This prevents steps from being missed also 

Hope that sheds some light onto the areas which seem like inefficiencies for you happy vaccination!

Harper it's time the next time the Lbs and NDP stand up and use the Swine flue to garner public support mention passing legislation to allow private healthcare also tell the public to get use to rationed healthcare because socialized medicine is rationed healthcare  Let's watch the Libs and NDP spin the fact that we'd all have the vaccine if we had two healthcare options

Pretty great scam eh? for billions upon billions of dollars in profit get an unproven untested vaccine on the population at tax payer expense and if there are any long term side effects the taxpayer foots the bill for damages as well 
Beautiful! You have to admire big pharma's ability to scam the public  No wonder organized crime diversified into this business in the 80's 
I find it very scary that in the U S they are hinting at making it the law and force vaccination for swine flu 

This from the same people who gave us Thalidomide for pregnant women and then told us there was absolutely no connection between all the disfigured flipper babies being born at the time and the Thalidomide given to their mothers and anyone who made the connection was clearly mad 

Obviously this virus by now has passed through the majority of us and we survived after a week of feeling weak and now have the antibodies to fight it naturally 
Question to all those who lined up to get their shots  Since the virus will probably keep on mutating does this mean you plan on getting shots every year for the rest of your lives for every mutation?
Perhaps you should set some money aside to pay for it since the taxpayer will be tapped out very shortly from all this as I am sure every upgrade will come with a higher price 

anyway no doubt I am wasting my time  I will sit back and judge the vaccine's effectiveness from what happens to all you Guinea pigs by next flu season  in the meantime I survived with my Acetaminophen and now have the antibodies

at 5:47 PM ETgarlet writes    John Baird is quoted as saying: This is the largest mass-immunization campaign in Canada's history said Baird  It goes without saying that 33 million Canadians cannot get vaccinated in a single day he said 

This is a trite defensive and weak response form a senior elected official  If it goes without saying then why did he say it?

The opposition is just as weak defensive and trite  Instead of making political hay out of this by criticizing the government they should offer solutions  They have been so busy recently threatening to bring down the government that they have not offered any alternatives to the current H1N1 situation or the economic situation  The opposition are paper tigers and I am really tired of Bob Rae 
================================

I have to take issue with the comment 'the opposition is weak' there is only so much they can do     all summer I heard the opposition giving ideas having meetings calling for more meetings offering ideas     The Heath Minister would have been wise to take the information and the collaboration they were offering but it was all rebuffed and spectacularly so          after all it was Carolyn Bennett that created the role and the office of Public Heath officer a few years back and with Dr Kirsty Duncan in opposition ranks who has pretty impressive experience with pandemics     there was a wealth of information to draw upon 

Harper's team chose not to work with anyone so if anything is going wrong I would suggest that it is all their fault     for example: do you know who warned that the roll-out would be a problem becuase of what we are seeing and warned not to do it like this    you got it the opposition the warned Agglukaq months ago about this

Of course provincial governments can't do a sensible rollout with appropriate advertising campaigns when the supply is dropping by 40 to 85 per cent!

Why is the number of doses going out to the provinces dropping so dramatically from what was promised just days ago? Has there been an unavoidable problem with production? If so what is it? Has the producer shifted shipments to a different buyer for some reason? Who and why? Was their some bureaucratic screw up in the Federal Ministry of Health? If so what and by who?

These are reasonable questions where there will be answers  I have no doubt if production had been unexpectedly halted by a fire at a production facility  we would have been told about it by now  The longer we go without answers to these relatively simple questions the more cynical I become about the likely answer 

Bad stuff happens  I can accept that when it is explained  But if some bureaucrat or politician screwed up I want them held accountable  And if the private company reneged on its commitments to ship to a more powerful customer out of sequence - I want them sued for every peeny they have 

Media could be of some help in demanding answers  They may be perfectly reasonable  But we won't know until the media do its job

Actually doesn't surprise me in the least  If you are the province or the city    your plan was really a moving target becuase the federal information was incomplete and last minute 

This week we got a federal postcard about H1N1 with information that was already weeks and weeks old (in other words it should have come to us long ago) The delay in information has prevented the provinces and cities from communicating well and the confusion with the delivery of the vaccine has made the roll-out all the more painful 

Combine that with 60 million dollars of Conservative self-promotion about the action plan versus 7 million spent communicating the H1N1 issues     and you have the makings of a real mess 

the Conservatives have had the nerve to laugh at the opposition all summer and on Monday every time they asked a question and offered suggestions            wonder how long they will be laughing for when the smoke clears on this     will it be a funny as the sexy isotopes or the dealth by a thousand cold cuts?

at 6:20 PM ETWow  So early into the immunization program and already there is a shortage of the vaccine  It is either poor planning by the government i e  they did not order enough or plan the rollout of immunization program properly there is some unforeseen problem with the production of the vaccine (which would be out of our control) or Canada is not getting access to the available vaccine for some reason 

But some of the reported responses from the government is a little hard to understand:
1) What is with the ridiculous comments from the health minister saying Canada still has more H1N1 vaccine doses per capita than any other country  The reality is there is a shortage in Canada so who cares if we have more per capita the other countries  Those other countries many not even have wanted or ordered the vaccine  Why is there a shortage and how do we fix it is what she needs to comment on 
2) I am not sure why there are so many comments from the goverment saying that health-care workers were working diligently to meet demand but that there were limits when the issue is not the health-care workers but rather a shortage of vaccine  The fact that they are starting to ration the supply (as per the headline) clearly indicates that  Both the Health Minister and the Transport Minister have been reported to have said it  It seems like they are just using misdirection onto the health-care workers rather then address the vaccine shortage  The long lineups were possibly due to availability fo health-care workers but not the vaccine shortage and rationing

Flu activity increases across Canada vaccine delivery to slow

On Thursday federal and provincial health officials said fewer doses of H1N1 vaccine are expected next week because the vaccine manufacturer GlaxoSmithKline has a single production line  The company had to stop producing adjuvanted vaccines to make the non-adjuvant type for pregnant women 

So for the hperfears of a few pregnant women the whole production of adjuvanted vaccine is stopped  I assume this was at the direct request of the Harper gov't who didn't look down the road at the consequences of their actions  Sounds like a competant decision to me! (sarcasm)

at 6:25 PM ETIts the media's fault this is happening  Most people know that the first wave of vaccinations was suppose to be for high priority groups (children seniors healthcare workers pregnant women care providers) 
Can you really blame them for not caring? The media has scared everyone into thinking that they're going to die if they don't get this shot 
What everyone needs to remember is that this is a flu  Treat it the same as the other flus  Be smart people and odds are you won't catch this virus

For the anti vaccine proponents out there do you think the chemtrail issue is a much bigger health concern then this man made virus and do you wonder why chemtrails have never made it to the CBC forum 
Anyone out there on both sides who disputes the existence of chemtrails and there potential impact to our health is an imbecile we need to start demanding answers to questions like these during election campaigns and not fall for the soap opera issues all parties like to raise during election time

at 7:56 PM ETI find it hard to believe that working as a correctional officer in a federal institution that the inmates are been givin first priority of this vaccine  Approx 50% offered so far have refused it and when you ask the nurses if the officers can get the shots the inmates don't want    they tell us that we are not a priority group  The funny part of that is that if H1N1 gets into the institution and we go into a quaratine situation    I as an Officer will be locked in with the inmates for possibly 2 weeks or more    funny isn't it    that convicted inmates are more important to the federal goverment then their own staff  Correct me if I am wrong but isn't there a shelf life of about 2 weeks of this vaccine before it goes bad?

at 8:12 PM ETMaybe we should be asking why this government has spent approx  1 billion dollars in planning for the pandemic to date yet when it has finally here the coordination supply of vaccine and straight forward information to all Canadians is so screwed up it is not funny 

Government had all departments setting up pandemic plans oriented only to keeping government functioning deciding who could work from home etc  But apparently not much in assuring that the necessary supply of vaccine and a federally coordinated plan to vacinate all Canadians in a reasonable time period was in place  They have one pharmaceutical company producing the supply and now it is down tooling to produce another variant for pregnant women  Is that necessary no doubt but H1N1 starting hitting people early this year why did they not get things rolling and coordinated then 

Vaccinating may generally be a provincial thing but a pandemic should override federal/provincial bureaucracy and the federal government should be taking the lead and setting the agenda  Otherwise why do we have a FEDERAL government

From what I understand people were asked that those who were at higher risk of catching this flu were asked to get immunized first- others to wait  But because some people who weren't high risk didn't wait now there is a shortage for those who really need it? 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
I don't think that's quite accurate  At least in Alberta we were told early in the week that there was lots of vaccine high-risk people should be vaccinated but the vaccine was available to everyone (if you recall early in the week many people were leery of getting the vaccine so they were trying to encourage people to be vaccinated)  Then there were those two deaths of healthy kids in Ontario and people swamped the clinics  Then only last night they announced that the manufacturer was shipping much less vaccine next week than originally planned and that's why a shortage is expected next week  Now they're telling only high-risk people to be vaccinated and others should hold off  So it's been a number of factors and a constantly changing scenario as the week progressed

For all those who are attacking healthy people who went to get vaccinated let us remember that the information we have all been receiving from health officials for the past month has created this situation  Until this week officials have been encouraging everyone to get the vaccine  Now they say there isn't enough  Furthermore we have heard of cases of supposedly healthy young adults dying  While these cases are probably very rare the media focus on these few cases nonetheless causes people to panic  Don't blame people for wanting a vaccine when health officials and the media have been waging a fear-mongering campaign for months  The people who created this mess are to be blamed and they need to deal with it

Little wonder the fear mongering of the media has taken hold      people grapple to find their own answers and take control of their own situation and health because those whose job it is to do that have utterly failed 

The media have been part of the problem  Just look at how many different reports/stories/updates etc  are posted on this site alone! Time to turn off the t v  and monitor your own situation  Do your own thinking

Do you remember when we kids what were the 2 biggest fears we had in life?

I struggled to remember being a kid an all I could only remember being scared of my teachers and wasps 

He said growing up in the 80's the biggest threat to us was total annihilation by assured mutual destruction from Soviet nukes or a slow and painful death from AIDs  This virus is small fry

at 9:20 PM ETI am so perplexed by the irresponsible superhyped media coverage of this flu pandemic treating it like the Black Plague when in reality statistically this flu is almost a non-event  even more perplexing is the fear mongering on the part of Health Canada scaring parents and citizens into a near panic--only to fall short of vaccine when vaccinations have been pushed and promised  what did they expect would happen when the media and government have spent the better part of the last two weeks terrifying us?

our family has taken an approach with quite a bit more critical thinking  we're doing the research and paying very close attention to the statistics 

and the handling of information and resources surrounding this new flu bug has been confusing frustrating and appalling in some cases  I feel sorriest for the doctors and nurses now dealing with the mass hysteria

So you see the conservatives are to blame they said in the news it was on schedule coming in October and 50 million doses  Conservative party has screwed up again 

So using your logic Americans can blame Democrats & Obama for being behind on their vaccine program  [Didn't the Yanks whine that we are in better shape in Canada than they?]

I believe most will agree competence & properly implemented programs are virtues most politicians - of all stripes - seem to lack  However as I posted earlier vaccine shortages have nothing to do with gov'ts [Tories / Liberals / Communist    ] but with pharma production ability that WHO said months ago would be unable to meet the vaccine needs of humanity 

Many of us [myself inclinded] will NOT take the shot; so there should be adequate supplies for those who wish to get vaccinated  Hopefully gov'ts around the world will learn from this regretable situation so that when a real pandemic arises; we will be better prepared  [It makes one wonder if we learned anything from SARS in 2003 Toronto ]

it makes me uneasy that the message to pregnant women has changed several times and keeps on changing because this tells me no one really knows if it's safe or not  at best they (researchers health officials) are making an educated guess     i don't want to be reading countless articles and listening to countless news reports about how the vaccine appears to have caused birth defects in a significant percentage of chidren who were in utero at the time  granted the odds of that are extremely low but it happens often enough to bear a bit of sober consideration

It starts with an introduction to the October 16TH 2009 Symposium of experts gathered at the Council On Foreign Relations to discuss the current developments of the alleged 2009 H1N1 Pandemic 
Held for many reasons it's main purpose was to generate concensus and set policies for Health Media Academia and State and Federal Government for the Pandemic  At the heart of the discussion was how to get the American public to take the unpopular H1N1 vaccines 

I'll let the audio from the meeting and the video speak for itself  But it should certainly make some reconsider the above article as far as the true validity of facts or intentions being projected out to the many eager masses out here now

NVIC also wants to know if the states are prepared to provide financial compensation to children injured by the swine flu vaccines whether parents will be given “complete truthful information about swine flu vaccine risks” and have the right to say “no” to vaccination 

Co-founder and president of NVIC Barbara Loe Fisher said [6]: “Parents and legislators should be asking themselves right now: Why are children the first to get experimental swine flu vaccines? Are schools equipped to get signed informed consent from parents before vaccination keep accurate vaccination records and screen out children biologically at high risk for suffering vaccine reactions? Will people giving these vaccines know how to monitor children afterwards and immediately record report and treat serious health problems that develop? And will states have the financial resources to compensate children who are injured?”

at 2:28 AM ETyou'll love this story folks
The study is co-authored by researchers from the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control the Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion and Laval University in Quebec 
The study began after researchers in British Columbia this summer found a possible link between contracting H1N1 and receiving flu shots the previous season for some people in the province 

The researchers shared the information with colleagues in the other provinces some of whom in turn found their own links said Dr  Kendall  Those results were collated into one study covering about 2000 confirmed cases of H1N1 in places such as British Columbia Ontario and Quebec  It found that people who got flu shots last year were about twice as likely to contract swine flu as those who weren't vaccinated according to sources who have seen the study's data 

The Public Health Agency of Canada commissioned an international panel of experts to take a look at the study's methodology that panel last week said it found no methodological errors and that the study has merit an agency spokeswoman said 

The WHO reviewed the Canadian study and data from other countries in a teleconference late last week with flu experts both inside and outside the agency including the Canadian researchers involved in the work  Based on that review WHO is not issuing any general warning about seasonal-flu vaccine spokeswoman Aphaluck Bhatiasevi said

3- Canada: address the shortage of nurse problem pay their tuitions increase their salaries do whatever but get us more nurses and while you are at it more radiologists and doctorsé

4- maybe its time to set up permanent facilities for shots of all kinds seasonal flu shots allergie shots diabetes whatever do lessen the stress on the doctors in general  Once these are in place they can also be used for emergency vaccine programmes like the H1N1

at 3:06 AM ETI'd like to respond to Chris H and others in the thread who have made comments about School Aged Children getting in the lines  I as a parent find this whole process disgraceful especially as it relates to children 

First off you don't know if the child in the line has an underlying medical issue  Asthma is very common amongst children the child could have Type 1 Diabetes or any other disorder 

Secondly in case you weren't paying attention a perfectly healthy 11 year old Girl in Cornwall is dead with this flu and a 13 year old boy from New Market is also 

When I was in the line with my toddler and asthmatic school aged child I was appalled by the number of Seniors clearly over the age of 65 clogging up the line  In fact I was among the first 40 people in the clinic because I came 2 5 hours early and sat in the lobby so that my kids could join me later  When I entered the room where they were administering the vaccine we were given numbers one colour for families with children and one colour adults without children  I was near the back of the pack of 40 and our number was 6 meaning that about 34 were the other colour 

What we are doing in these clinics is the equivalent of the adults getting on the lifeboats first the disregard for the wellbeing of our children is shameful

---------------------------------------------------------------------
I disagree  If we start rating people's priority based on lifestyle choices then we should also put last on the list fat people since obesity has been clearly identified as a risk factor for complications  Maybe while we're at it we should also put low on the list people who don't excercise regularly  Or people who don't eat a balanced diet  Or people who don't get enough sleep  Or     who's next?

1- I know for a fact that there we children without asthma or other underlying conditions as the parents were telling their children if the nurse asks just say you have asthma where the child responded but I don't where the parent responsded just say it you need the vaccine 

2- children of school age are not on the priority list because it has been deemed these children are not at risk of fatalities from the swine flu as are asthmatics cancer patients heart patients babies pregnants mothers etc   2 deaths of school aged children compared to the amount that have recovered without issues is hardly a reason to justify not following the established guideline by the professionals jumping the queue creating longer lineups for the sick

at 3:27 AM ETChris HS I assume that you don't have any School Aged Children (perhaps no kids at all)  Because in my experience only a childless person could take comfort in stats 

In Cornwall when a perfectly healthy 11 year old girl died of this Flu the local Medical Officer of Health expanded the program to every child under 18 and he was right to do so 

Kids are out in schools everyday not sitting at home in some apartment  They are exposed to every bug around 

You know what I don't blame any parent to takes their school aged child to the lines because you know what the damn Government has known about this Flu for a year and every school aged child in the Country should have been givern the vaccine if they wanted it at school the 2nd or 3rd week of September 

This roll out is Amateur Hour and the Federal Minister of Health should table her resigination  Another dud in a Government made up of duds 

As a parent you will climb over hot coals to protect you children you can discount these people as Soccer moms or whatever but I won't blame one of them for working around a completely flawed system

For the record I'm not a smoker never have been and I jog 20 km per week  I just have a real problem when priority lists start getting made up based on lifestyle choices  Most people have made some bad lifestyle choices -- smoking drinking lack of exercise over-eating eating junk food etc etc  I think picking on any group for making poor choices is akin to bullying  Priority groups first if there is a limited supply but everyone else is in the same boat after that IMO

Surely we can't start rationing based on that  I know that smokers are the newest favourite target of everyone but really if you think it through the argument doesn't hold up

3- the vaccine is already bases on lifestyle choices: people were not born healthcare workers born pregnant or other they are all lifestyle choice it makes sense to expand it so that smokers who damage their lungs do not get a free vaccine to protect their lungs also

at 6:13 AM ETThe conflict among respondents to this newspaper shows an ugly side of Canada as some would push others out of the way in order to be vaccinated as some would exclude others  It's the shrinking waterhole syndrome at its worst 

On the other hand if there were preparedness we might not even need to consider who gets the vaccine first  Leona Agglukkaq clearly dropped the ball on this one  Everyone saw the flu coming just read the news  The research could have been accelerated somewhat if we'd had adequately funded and staffed federal health laboratories  We don't due to mistaken priorities of this government  The production of the vaccine could have been and still could be accelerated if we were not enriching one or two corporations instead of declaring the vaccine public property and authorizing its production at all possible facilities  It's all in the mindset since we have the capability 

Since I'm not in the priority group I'm going to try to build my resistance with some vitamins to increase my odds of not getting the virus by airing rooms and washing compulsively  this may help keep down other germs too  Good hygiene might become a habit among us all

What did the Federal Government think was going to happen? They've been preaching abou the importance of getting the vaccine they ordered 50 million doses the media picks up on some of the deaths surrounding it and all hell breaks loose and they don't have the 50 million doses ready at once     Because they physically can't get that many ready

They have been talking about this for so long and were well aware of what was going to happen why was all the vaccine needed not in Canada months ago ready to be dispursed to all Canadians 


Influenza vaccines take 6 months to produce  The H1N1 strain was identified in April  Add 6 months and you get vaccines out in October  This was done as quickly as possible 

The reason it takes 6 months is that the virus must be grown in chicken eggs which takes time  There are multiple companies making influenza vaccine and they all came out at about the same time  If there were a quicker way to manufacture influenza vaccine one of the companies would have done it 

There are quicker ways of making influenza vaccine but they are experimental and haven't been licensed so they couldn't be used

Let's do some math  So in the last three weeks we got 2 million doses per week for a total of 6 million  Apparently these are all gone now so the 50 9 million is down to 44 9 million doses we bought 

So obviously GSK has been making this stuff without approval and it was 'found' to be safe  Well actually it was compared to another vaccine with similar properties  This other vaccine of which I am still looking for apparently is 'safe' 

So if GSK can only supply us 400K doses per week it will take 112 weeks to fill the order  Remember the money is already gone 

Well if H1N1 isn't a scare anymore because we were promised a vaccine then withholding the vaccine becomes the next scare

at 12:27 PM ETIn dealing with the epidemic of H1N1 the government has locked all the doors of a crowded theatre and then shouted Fire!  We have been told repeatedly over the last few weeks that we must all get our shot or we'll die and the News has been full of the stories of those few people who have sadly died from H1N1  This alarm-spreading is fine since we need 70% coverage to protect the whole population  However the Government had previously arranged by giving the contract to just one company running just one production line for there to be a drastic shortage of the vaccine just at the time it would be most needed  Presumably this saved money 
It might be possible to justify either of these government actions separately at different times but not both simultaneously  By doing both together they are causing a panic without offering any remedy

Good communication is a situation like this is essential but our federal bureaucrats appear to have failed miserably in keeping on top of their contractor

Of course not  Are they infused with pathogens designed to cause disease? Of course not  It's time for the conspiracy theorists to seriously get a life and maybe a full-time job so they have something else to devote their energy too  Oh yes and for the record vaccines do NOT cause autism  Or global warming either

You are just adding to the misinformation  Fact: Canada has ordered 50 million doses  Fact: The feds have received 6 million doses so far 

As for the US they are still in a worse position than we are here  They have ordered 150 million doses and have received about 24 million doses  So per capita we have about 3 times as much vaccine as they do in the US

at 1:23 PM ETHere in Calgary a 5th clinic was opened specifically for high risk groups  When I took my wheelchair bound severely disabled daughter I was told she did not qualify as she did not fall into the three groups : children 6 months - 10 years pregnant women and seniors  She would have to wait in the regular lineups just like anyone else  I have Spinal Stenosis (brought the medical report with me) and can not stand for more than 20 minutes at a time without severe nerve pain  I too would have to queue up for a 4+ hour wait just like everyone else  It seems to me that if you can stand (read this as underlined) in line for 4+ hours something expectant mothers and seniors can not healthily do then are you really at high risk? It would appear that those considered at high risk have been left to flounder as they are pushed aside by the able-bodied in the panic rush 
My family doctor plans to hold her own clinic but she can't order the vaccine until 02Nov and it will be 06Nov(hopefully) before it arrives  We have to pay for the nurse's time ($5) but they already have access to our medical records so our doctor already knows who the high risk group members are 
In my experience as a Community Nurse patients at high risk or with chronic conditions already have Family doctors and can be easily screened 
This should have been rolled out through Family doctors leaving the mass clinics for those that don't have a Family doctor or are at low risk  As it is my daughter and I will have to wait until our family doctor can hopefully get the vaccine  Being that it will then take 14 days for the dose to reach protection level and that the second H1N1 wave started 5-6 weeks ago the federal and provincial governments caring attitude appears too little too late

I basically agree with your post but I think they slipped 2 million or so before the 26th and have dropped down to 2 million per week instead of 3 million  Hopefully they can get production back up to 3 million per week  Still Canada is doing really well compared to the US  Some provinces like Ontario are dropping the ball in getting the stuff into people's arms  Vaccine still in the package does nothing for anybody

8 - Can you provide evidence that the amount of mercury is dangerous? What other additives are dangerous?
7 - Legal immunity? No  If GSK decides to poison us all out of malice they will be held responsible  What's happened is that the government is taking responsibility for any problems that may arise due to the streamlined marketing approval process 
6 - We shouldn't take the vaccine because of RUMOURS? Those rumours are based on NO EVIDENCE and don't stand to scrutiny 
5 - What does the media response tell you about the vaccine?
4 - Emergency declaration?
3 - You have *NO FREAKING CLUE* as to what you're talking about! The viral genes were sequenced hundreds of times in labs all over the world  Labs all over the world had access to the virus sequenced its genes and deposited those sequences into public databases  The virus was NOT kept from competitors 
2 - What does that tell you about the vaccine?
1 - Pharmaceutical firms have been doing fine during the economic downturn and I really doubt that the $300 million that the government paid for doses (and distribution) is a significant chunk of change to pharmaceutical companies like GSK 

Your post is so silly! Most of the points you make tell us *NOTHING* about the risk:benefit ratio of the vaccine versus influenza

Again another incidence of not letting facts get in the way of an ideological rant  Firstly the Ontario Liberal Government would not have sold the vaccine to the clinic at a profit  The vaccine would have been distributed by the local Health Unit using whatever criteria it uses to distribute vaccine to private physicians  In any event I expect that the Ministry will soon put a stop to the scheme as it has put stops to other similar schemes  Secondly criminals living in closely confined conditions are a a high risk group  I would rather see them getting the vaccine than getting the flu and having to spend much more on hospital care on overtime for the guards who accompany them to hospital on sick time for guards who catch the flu on overtime for the guards who cover for the sick guards and for all of the other costs associated with an outbreak in a corrections institution

I am a law abiding tax paying school teacher  I have not gone for the flu shot - neither have my two children 8 and 12  My son was sick a week and a half ago - as were 30% of his class  His hockey team had only 9 skaters out of 17 today - 2 on trips and the rest sick  My daughter has had 2 halloween parties cancelled because of the flu hitting the hosts - one child's mother called me in tears b/c her 12 year old child was doing badly - an other wise healthy child 
If you step down from your high horse for a second - and get some thicker air into your lungs then maybe your brain will function better - this is an outbreak among school communities 
I teach high school  One of my classes had 40% absent over the last two school days and 4 kids hacking up a lung in class on friday - at least one of those teenagers is in hospital  In another class two girls recently returned after 1 week ill - one was hospitalized and the other managed at home  Both are smokers and both have since had a relapse and are off sick again- both in hospital today  Tango why don't you help in a local school for the next month and see how you feel as everyone around you falls ill  No where else in society is being hit as hard as the schools - check the health canada web site - 220 of 226 outbreaks last week were in schools 
The actions of those jumping the que is no different than politians CEO's or torch bearers  The thin veneer of civililization - New Orleans Katrina get a gun

Would you stop with that nonsense? You can't possibly think without any proof at all that the 1918 flu was a plot  Some guy told a story and that's all it is   a story  Did you ever see the Davinci Code? Same crap  Write a story with historical references and a whole lot of BS 

It is entertaining  It helps if you know that some people think Rockefeller wants everyone dead  He became the worlds first billionaire in 1916     made his money in oil mostly but also was involved in banking shipping railroads almost everything  The story goes that because it was rockefeller the drug companies he owned made a bio weapon by mistake  This guy makes bill gates look like a 649 winner and the story goes he mistakenly (or maybe it was on purpose) kills 50 million  This mistake was so powerful when injected into a human the resulting effect is for that person to create a flu virus and then die  Seriously the story is the yellow fever vaccine was injected into soldiers and it incubated the 1918 flu virus that killed 50 million 

Nothing that powerful has ever been created since and it was created years before viruses were even identified by scientists 

You see the first major outbreaks in the us started in army bases  Did soldiers catch a flu while in europe and bring it home from WW1 front lines? Not according to this story you see the vaccine they got when they were at war finally incubated the 1918 flu 

It is just a story with some historical references

Not according to what I can find 

An August 6 2009 press release:

http://www phac-aspc gc ca/media/nr-rp/2009/2009_0806-eng php

> Canadian vaccine production remains on target  Clinical trials are expected to begin by October if not sooner and if all goes well immunization programs will begin by November  <

Another release dated October 7 2009:

http://www phac-aspc gc ca/media/nr-rp/2009/2009_1007-eng php

> “Let me be perfectly clear in early November we will have a safe and effective vaccine that will begin rolling out to all Canadians who want and need it” said Minister Aglukkaq  <

I believe that at least a few other posters have pointed out that the government had consistently said that it would begin administering the vaccine in early November 

Plus they didn't say that they already had 50 million doses but that they had ordered 50 million doses

The modern process for making viruses for vaccines involves incubating them under specific conditions for specific time frames  Somehow that process was reproduced at least 150 million times in an age before viruses were identified refrigeration wasn't commonplace transportation of medicines wasn't done under 'ideal' conditions    and by mistake? The easiest way to prove that's not true is just by repeating it   yet you repeat it as if its possible

I've studied both sides of the issue  Some - such as Dr  Ott - allege the 1918 Spanish flu was the direct consequence of the Rockefeller typhus fever vaccine virus mutating into a lethal form ~ like the recent situation in Nigeria with the polio vaccine  The links of timing: pathogen appearance 1915/16 / initial prevalence among vaccinated troops / USA & other sites     provide a plausible link to Rockefeller's vaccine  [Not unlike WW2 troop adverse side-effects to another Rockefeller's vaccine reported in TIME ]

News sources state this global pandemic was unprecedented in human history  There is no evidence this influenza occurred naturally  However it's logical to perceive a direct link between vaccine and subsequent fatal side-effects  We have many documented examples to illustrate this reality 

In the meantime I eagerly await the opportunity to review the sources you allege debunk this viewpoint

sorry Gus if you've studied it then you aren't understanding it  The polio vaccine problem didn't actually create a virus  They got as cheap as possible because we don't seam to take removing polio from the planet serious enough to pay for a better vaccine  This cheap vaccine was the nasal kind that uses weakened live viruses  Well this weakened live virus wasn't really weakened was it? It was a bad batch  It was used fine in other places one bad batch infected some people in a specific place 

Even your time magazine 'proof' is irrelevant  Soldiers got jaundice from a batch of vaccines  This isn't the creation of a virus is basically a tainted vaccine  Those were some dirty primitive days when it came to medicine  It was common place to bleed people to cure them  That doesn't mean life was created by mixing yellow fever vaccine  They weren't incubating viruses they didn't even know viruses existed  To infer that an injection of a crappy vaccine somehow made the most lethal virus in recent history without any reason other then the name rockefeller could be seen  Your own fantasy stories say it was by mistake so why do they keep throwing his name into the mix? You think he was the one creating 100 million vaccines? His secret recipe that could transform a yellow fever virus into an avian h1n1?

[M-96 remark ~ Avian H5N1 was known at least a year prior to the 1997 Brevig Mission extraction of the 1918 influenza ]

An important note about concerns from health authorities regarding lethal Avian H5N1 virus  While avian bird flu was found in 1878 and first human fatalities ocurred in Hong Kong during 1997 the concern is the virus in its current form in 2002  Quoting from two sources    
The mutation and spread of the viruses between 1999 and 2002 apparently set the stage for the simultaneous emergence of the acute disease in many countries  [Origin of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus in China and genetic characterization of donor and recipient viruses ~ Journal of General Virology 2007 88 p 3094] /// The virus that is making Oxford and the world's flu experts nervous made its debut in the Far East around two years ago ~ H5N1  BBC News [12/13/2004]
http://news bbc co uk/go/pr/fr/-/2/hi/science/nature/4092709 stm

Osterholm cited signs H5N1 virus could cause the same kind of severe disease as the 1918 H1N1 virus if it triggered a pandemic     researchers recently have largely recreated the 1918 virus     the pathology is identical to what we saw in 1918 and in human cases of H5N1 he said  [11/15/2004]
http://id-center apic org/cidrap/content/influenza/avianflu/news/nov1504mto html

Are [2002] lethal avian H5N1 + Novel-H1N1 man-made viruses with possible links to 1918 pathogen recreation (2003/05)? Normal bird and swine flu - occurring in the natural - are harmless to humans  Are these bio-agent developments for strategic military purposes that somehow were released in the wild?

Apparently you didn't carefully read the article or are deliberately putting an erroneous slant on it  The vaccine came in vials for oral use and contained a live attenuated virus just like some Novel-H1N1 vaccines [though not those for use in Cda]  Nowhere is any reference made to bad batches  A figment of one's imagination perhaps?

Even your time magazine 'proof' is irrelevant  Soldiers got jaundice from a batch of vaccines  This isn't the creation of a virus is basically a tainted vaccine 
The soldiers did not come down with yellow fever; but they suffered side-effects from the vaccine  As I posted in an earlier article vaccines in the early 20th century appeared to undergo technological development  The early vaccines [including first polio vaccines] proved fatal to some patients 

The vaccine link to virus mutation and subsequent creation of 1918 deadly pathogen [unprecedented in human history] is both plausible and probable; offering a credible explanation of pathogen appearance c a  1915/16 initial prevalence among vaccinated soldiers and USA origin  Vaccines have been documented to have caused harmful side-effects even fatalities  To deny the above is to deny reality 

Now where are sources to debunk this scenario? Show readers a credible alternative substantiated by similar findings in recorded history!

===========

It's not probable or plausible  A bacteria generally delivered by bugs isn't going to mutate into an avian flu virus! A source is required to debunk this? A credible alternative is the 1918 flu was a natural flu! Substantiated by findings in recorded history? Every credible history source says the 1918 flu was a flu  Yes you can find stories where vaccines hurt and even killed people excepcially from the turn of the centruy but to say one was able to create a new form of life is the works of science fiction  I know you want to believe these ridiculous stories but I also think you are too many years from basic high school biology  You are saying a cat gave birth to a potato 

You do know that just because you're concerned about vaccines you don't have to believe every kook story that concludes all vaccines ever created are pure evil

at 2:57 PM ETSorry I said nasal instead of oral vaccine Gus  It really doesn't matter  The fact it is was the cheapest way to make a vaccine and it gave people polio because the live weakened virus wasn't weakened  That same vaccine was used safely elsewhere but yes you have found a case where the vaccine hurt dozens    (please admit other polio vaccines it saved hundreds of millions) 

Why is it so hard for you to admit the 1918 flu was natural? At least your claim that this flu was man made is technically possible (still no evidence except rantings of possibly insane people) but there was no viral biologists then or now able to make what the story claims 

Gus there is no way to defeat your strawman beyond attempting to reason with common sense  It honestly doesn't need to be debunked because there is no proof it could be possible  Prove your 'bunk' and it can be debunked 

Your proof is some people got sick from being injected by vaccines in the past  Jumping from people getting sick to a vaccine creating a pandemic is not the next logical step  Since you do not understand the argument I tried wording it differently and I'll try once again  You are basically claiming someone invented a microwave oven by mistake 50 years before electricity    I don't understand a better way to word it your claim is just that far gone from reality 

Actually I may be a bit confused here because the story kinda contradicts itself  Are you saying that 50 million died AFTER being injected by the vaccine? Or that once the vaccine was injected the result was a virus that killed 50 million? The story tries to confuse the reader by pointing to both at the same time but really there can be only one  Which is it?

at 6:18 PM ETI'll try to be a bit more clear Gus  here is a quote from your 'proof':

The 1918 virus pandemic was the direct result of TYPHUS FEVER VACCINES injected into millions of soldiers during the Great War (WW I)  John D  Rockefeller labs and factories in China produced these Typhus vaccines in 1916 by harvesting pus from infected humans injecting the infectious matter into pig hosts then mixing the harvested contaminants into chicken egg albumin to be injected into human hosts as a “vaccine” 

The 1918 flu virus was an Avian H1N1 flu  You even site sources that state as much  Injecting human pus into a pig and collecting the something from the pig and putting that into an egg is bound to have all kinds of bacteria that very well could be fatal but this will not create an Avian H1N1 virus  Had you stopped at vaccines made some soldiers sick and killed some that would have been fine but no where in this mixture does an Avian flu virus appear 

This isn't an opinion Gus mixing a bunch of bacteria together will not make an avian flu virus  Your point that vaccines have been bad in the past isn't affected by admitting the 1918 flu was natural  It even helps your delusion about the 1918 flu virus being harvested from frozen corpses and mutated by evil scientists and released as the current outbreak  Anything that could be made in 1918 from some pus and a pig and an egg could be easily reproduced  Why not do it again with modern equipment? If people were able to make this 90 years ago without being able to identify viruses wouldn't they be able to make it from scratch now that they can break down dna? And it be a million times more effective? Why harvest that mistake?

Your evidence is sick people during a pandemic

I was not planning to reply to your post since the content of your previous posts reveals you're neither interested in the truth nor apparently competent to research this topic seriously  It's not my intent to be rude; it's a candid comment 

For the benefit of readers who may be wondering if diseases appearing in the past century are from natural causes or vaccines or military bio-agents [or from all three variables]; the following is but one link I would encourage you to investigate;
http://www whale to/vaccine/sf1 html
It provides a far more in-depth of the vaccine ~ Spanish flu link than by Dr  Ott from a medical person with direct experience on this subject  Dr McLean's observations also address the 1977 swine flu scam than have many parallels with the latest Novel-H1N1 hype  For those with vaccine safety concerns her observations may also be relevant 

I have also reviewed several other sources ~ some recent and some that date to WW1 ~ about this lethal 1918 pathogen  Dr McLean's observations may be among the best to reveal the vaccine ~ pathogen relationship

I'm glad you brought up this subject  I visited the site and read the patent  I'm not an expert in this field  It reminds me of another site I visited a few months ago where they claimed one of the major pharmas had been caught red-handed submitting a swine flu vaccine patent in 08 for the 09 strain  It turned out it was a regular patent for producing vaccines and there was nothing sinister about the patent  [This seems to be a similar situation; but I'm not an authority on patents ]

A few weeks ago I posted my own insights that all sources of information should be read with caution ~ whether they are respected pharma-funded scientific articles or alerts from conspiracy websites or information from other sources [news / blogger posts / etc ] 
Personally I have benefited from all three avenues of information

anyway that story doesn't really answer my main question  This says soldiers got sick so were given vaccines  They got more sick so they gave them stronger vaccines   this cycle apparently repeated itself until someone created the flu  And this claim is backed up by    what? There is no evidence at all  They quickly jump to 1957 to point to people getting sick   then it returns to 1918 to claim that doctors killed millions with treatments  A little shout out to homeopaths to keep them on side  All just claims with no evidence  You can do so much better Gus  This is a really lame attempt at 'proof' 

You are linking to a story on a antisemitic website about a story that doesn't reference any proof or source of the information  Did the author witness all this? Is he a vampire?

The gist of the story is if you keep injecting serums into sick people you can create a lethal avian flu virus capable of killing 1/3 of those it infects  Now if this were possible why haven't we witnessed dozens of such outbreaks? If the biggest in recent recorded history was created by fluke why can't we do better now that we have cracked DNA? Or do you think they are beyond mistakes in that they couldn't release one?

I do care about the truth Gus  Unlike quite a few if presented with evidence that was contrary to my beliefs then my beliefs would change  I actually would like a reason to not be injected with this vaccine because I have no interest in standing in line for a couple hours  But the fact is there is no evidence to suggest I shouldn't  This vaccine even while still in trials is still safer then the alternative

How many know WW1 troops were given a cocktail of vaccines like those who fought in Desert Storm ~ with similar tragic side-effects (GWS is but one of several harmful afflictions troops suffered and passed on to family members and the public ~ per 1995 Capt J Riley's presentation)  Her insight of 1991 Desert Storm parallels Higgins 245-page report to the U S  President of WW1 

The A/H1N1 [Novel-H1N1 swine flu] seems linked to the 1918 pathogen recreation  WHO / CDC over-exaggeration of A/H1N1 stats [as uncovered by CBS] may have deceived the public in two ways: (1) widespread infection (actually about 5% of cases); (2) understated low mortality rate of 0 6% (likely around 5% maybe higher)  [1918 pathogen ~ 8-9% range?]  This supports suspicions A/H1N1 may be a bio-agent; and Wisconsin likely ground zero 

It seems mega-pharmas have been given a bum rap  To be sure they will capitalize on vaccine sales being the opportunists they are  This virus was likely released from military or medical research facilities and I suspect a cover-up began with CDC / WHO / U S  gov't to do damage control  Mexico took the bum rap for swine flu in 2009 like Spain took the bum rap for 1918 pathogen in 1918  [The real cause of outbreak is concealed from public ]

I'm not a conspiracy theorist - per se - but after months of researching Novel-H1N1 swine flu issues + blogger comments + your link to situation involving Joseph Moshe     it makes one wonder if conspiracy theorists may be right after all 

Baxter is correctly implicated - releasing seasonal vaccine with lethal bird flu in Austria in early 2009; but the Polish issue of injecting 350 homeless men with lethal avian H5N1 vaccine in 2008 is tied to Novartis [not Baxter as your link states] per p 67 of J B 's FBI report 
A few days ago English-language Ukrainian news source [Kyiv Post] said a mysterious pathogen appeared in Oct that had authorities worried  Regular influenza + A/H1N1 swine flu were partly responsible for an unusually severe epidemic in western Ukraine 

86 died since mid-Oct [5 from A/H1N1 confirmed] ~ 24000 hospitalized / 0 5 million infected out of 24 million population; WHO 'assumes' it's from A/H1N1  Uke's deputy chief medical officer vehemently denied rumours that the west of the country was suffering from an outbreak of plague  [AFP news clip included in Kyiv Post]
It makes one wonder if J M 's allegation that Baxter released a bio-agent disguised as a vaccine in Ukraine has some merit  This is similar to genocide concerns expressed in J B 's June 09 FBI report 

Is the vaccine possibly a bio-weapon some conspiracy sites are alleging? [At least in some parts of the world such as Ukraine that could be expand into a full-blown global lethal pandemic not seen since 1918?] That's a scary scenario!!!

By the way the gulf war reference is irrelevant  You can claim people got sick from a vaccine but it didn't introduce a flu virus capable of killing 1/3 infected  Your gulf war claim only applies to those injected AS DOES EVERY OTHER REFERENCE YOU MENTION!!!! You can make all kinds of claims about people getting injected having issues but that is not the topic I am interested in  I am not sure why this point isn't being conveyed  The claim that people got injected and from that injection a flu was born that killed millions  This needs your attention Gus  What information do you have that substantiates this claim?

You claim injecting people created a flu that spread around the planet killing millions  Now you claim to have read more information and are now convinced this is true  What is this new information Gus?

The 1000's who die are but a small handful of the billions who get the flu  If the swine flu were to spread as widely as the regular flu does every year there would be approximately a million times as many cases of it as there have been so far  And possibly approximately a million times as many deaths from it as there have been so far 

Even given the small reach (so far) of this emerging disease can you understand why containing and understanding it might just be important to some people? Or are you a die-hard cheermonger?

As an Aboriginal woman I am particular worried about this flu in some of our native communities where there are many people (sometimes up to 15 people) live in one house due to housing shortages  Close contact guarantees more people passing on their germs 
While I am taking precautions with my own family insisting my two teens wash their hands etc  when coming into the house etc  we are still coming into contact with others who do not heed these basic rules  I had one woman with a nasty cough spew her germs (she did not cover her mouth) right behind me at timmy's so I beat a hasty retreat  Next week I am riding my bike to work rather than transit another prime place for catching germs

See    that's where you are failing to distinguish between fact and story 

Sure some media is hyping things  Sure some 'initial reports' are proven wrong later 

But I bet I could find reference in at least half the 35 links to the right about HOW and WHY the numbers if infection cases vary   

The CONFIRMED cases by WHO are always going to be behind the reported number of cases in any given region as the WHO ONLY RECOGNISES results from certain tests performed certain ways in certain labs 

These tests take time  The results are slow 

So there is your Myth # 1 busted : The media lies about the numbers!!!

Now if you care to read on perhaps you will learn something 

i am not saying it is time to panic for sure! But why shut down any time the term comes up - instead why not be open-minded and learn and cull the useful information from the crap?

From WHO int - As of 06:00 GMT 8 May 2009 24 countries have officially reported 2384 cases of influenza A (H1N1) infection 

Mexico has reported 1112 laboratory confirmed human cases of infection including 42 deaths  The United States has reported 896 laboratory confirmed human cases including two deaths

Actually this has been misread by alot of people  You are correct that a pandemic is a global something but the something is an epidemic and this
is not an epidemic  An epidemic means higher than normal infection rate but the rate of infection for this is far less than other strains of flu  In one day
300000 people get the flu  So this is not an epidemic and therefore it cannot be a pandemic either  The media uses these terms in such an inappropriate way  Don't forget that the WHO is staffed by scientists who have a direct benefit from the pharmaceutical companies  So if the word pandemic seems appropriate they will use it but it doesnt mean thats actually what it is  The experts have a vested interest to make this sound as bad as possible because their paycheck comes from the ones who want to see as many people get sick as possible so that they can test their products on large numbers of people  In the 1970s reappeared in Arctic Canada (i was there on the front lines) we were actually dealing with only a few isolated villages on Baffin Island  But the WHO got a hold of it and called it a pandemic when a few cases of TB showed up in the Russian Arctic  It was nothing of the sort  In fact WHO had absolutely no background data at all about this (i e  how many Inuit normally have TB) and blew it out of proportion

Maybe the ultimate weapon of mass destruction is not an explosive but a virus perhaps administered and spread through a rogue vaccine producer or by an airplane 

Maybe these possibilities are mere paranoid delusions of tin foil conspiracy nuts 

Or maybe they're not   

But please don't let the news media do your thinking for you    because who in the media has the guts to risk their reputation and their jobs to pursue such possibilities?

However far out there someone seems to be keep an open mind and appreciation for freedom of speech and the right to comment through the internet

One of which is the timing of it's arrival  Seems it showed up just when all the tamiflu made to deal with the bird flu is expiring 

Also interesting that a woman called in a New York radio station and reported that the Department of Homeland Security was comissioning private truckers to haul loads of refrigerated liquid for which they were givin a vaccine all across the States  The vid was added on You tube on April 14 
I'm also a bit fuzzy on how three different kinds of flu just happened to get together and create a new virus  I'm sorry but it sounds manufactured to me 

I've read how it's said to have happened but do you mean to tell me that through the entire coarse of human history no chickens were ever kept in proximaty to a pig in an environment that could be considered not quit sanitary by a farmer that might have been sick?
How is it that this managed to just pop up now?

at 11:46 AM ETAlthough some of you are skeptical about the swine flu you shouldn't write it off as part of some great conspiracy plot by the drug companies 

The swine flu HAS been seen in the past and it has existed for a long time however it seems to have become more virulent  I do however agree that it is important to look at this information critically  The original outbreak was in Mexico which is densely populated and therefore the transmission of such a virus occurs fairly rapidly  Then there is the question of access to proper health care and diagnosing  All of these factors and more have contributed to the spread of the virus in Mexico and its mortality rate 

Nonetheless  it is extremely important that each individual do their part to protect themselves and those around them  Its as simple as washing your hands and staying home if you are sick  Any travels to Mexico should be reconsidered and visits to the emergency rooms should only be done in an emergency  When it comes to washing your hands you can never do it too often  Using regular soap is fine and use a little bit of force (like scrubbing)  Make sure to moisturize your hands from the frequent washing to avoid cracking of dry skin (which can make you more vulnerable to bacteria and viruses)  People with asthma and other underlying medical conditions may have a particularly difficult time battling the virus for which reason taking these precautions is very important  Finally the regular flu virus claims thousands of lives every year in Canada  These simple guidelines can help you dodge any infection

at 12:00 PM ETO kay I see a lot of thumbs down on my last comment 
I don't want to offend anyone but personally I find the idea of biological warfare much scarier than nuclear weapons  Don't get me wrong both are plenty scary but at least when it comes to nukes we have some idea of what to expect 
Now I'm not going to try to push anyone's opinion one way or the other but I am one of those people who thinks there was much more going on behind 9/11 and 7/7 than what the media told us 
I looked into the evidence suggesting that they were inside jobs and it's very compelling especially when the authorities were not so forth coming with information 
Look into it for yourselves and form your own opinion but I don't trust the media much given who owns it all 
Here where I live we've had cases of the new flu everywhere but the media isn't reporting it  I think we've only had four media confirmed cases and a dozen diagnosed at the hospital  So if this is how censored the media is in New Brunswick how censored is it in more populated area's?
I don't mean to burst anyone's comfort bubble but I'd like to see as many people as possible survive what ever's coming next 
In our first confirmed case of H1N1 type A a young lady coming home from Mexico became ill and went to the hospital  They sent her home with a bottle of tylenol  After a couple of days she felt better and hadn't heard anything about her test results so she went back to work    I'm going to let that sink in for a second   she went back to work 
Later her travel companions called her from thier homes in Ontario to tell her that they had been diagnosed with the H1N1 type A influenza  She then went back to the hospital and was told by her doctor that she had tested possitive for it also

When will you brighten up and learned that facts? starvation is preventable and traffic accidents are in some ways preventable  The important part is they don't spread 

Currently the H1N1 cases are increasing rapidly and the truth is tamiflu doesn't really have much of an effect on it  And the H1N1 vaccine is still under experiment and may not come out until a few months later  For the very last time why everyone is so worried and concerned is because the H1N1 virus may mutate ( through combining with another virus found on pigs or humans ) then it can turn into a deadly form which may spread even more rapidly  Yes I'm pretty tired of repeating this 

This is clearly not playing with numbers but more of are we ready to battle against the H1N1 IF there is an unfortunate outbreak 

Sometimes I wonder why Canadians tend to be more laid back in general and we forget about the importance of taking preventive measures 

if you are from B C and listened to FM94 5 the beat Kidd carson was joking about the N95 face masks on his show  My reaction was like wow are you kidding me? it wasn't even funny they are N95 face masks who cares how you look after you put them on I don't really care if you look like a dinosaur or a bird with the N95 masks on  They are supposed to limit air flow prevent most virus and would definitely fog up your glasses

I see above it now reads Last Updated: Saturday May 9 2009 | 12:47 AM ET even though your last post at 10:01 pm on May 10th states it read Last Updated: Friday May 8 2009 | 10:47 PM MT  So how could you have made this post on the 10th of May  (Note there is a discrepency in time zone here as well )

That is strange and perhaps you should contact CBC directly and inquire about that  Then again I have observed several times in the past they will often switch headlines or entire articles and yet keep the threads intact 

In the version I read earlier today the article stated: (1) there was confusion over the age of the victim as earlier reports suggested she was an elderly woman (2) she was said to have lived in a northern community was hospitalized in High River (I believe it was but this article has now been edited so I'm not sure although I do remember the community was not named since I live in northern AB and wanted to know where she was from) and (3) it was not clear if the woman was infected form a relative or vice versa 

As well other Alberta newspapers have reported this woman had chronic asthma which still has not been included in this article 

You say the article wasn't edited but you apparently didn't read it earlier today so you wouldn't know  Ask any of the other readers here who did read the story earlier today (oops now it is May 10th yesterday) or write an editor at CBC and ask personally 

Cheers

Earlier reports indicated an elderly woman had died but Corriveau said the woman was in her 30s  He would not say what community the woman was from 


Glad to see that *someone* was willing to give the location even if the CMO was not  Thank you 
==============================================================

I admit I somehow missed the part about Gift Lake but this post should demonstrate the fact that at 10 AM on May 9th this article did in fact state there was confusion over the age of the victim  A fact that I was easily able to clear up with an Alberta news search

Third US death plus one from Costa Rica 

This is NOT following the pattern of seasonal influenza - it's not hardly touching the elderly and babies two groups who are often hit hard  This latest death again is someone in their 30s 

As for the issue of editing the articles - happens quite frequently  Headlines change bits get added removed changed around story becomes something else entirely

at 11:10 AM ETI should also mention that the flu shot is not really a good answer to the problem though as it contains Thamerisol 
Check this out MMR is a title of a vaccine invented by Merck Pharmaceutical  Once they took the Thamerisol out of the vaccination surrounded by the State of California the autism rate went down by 35%  Thamerisol is a brand cross for murcery  Murcery kills nerves and your nerves are a see in your brain which wallah    Autism --http://www dcqna com/diseases-conditions/2317-diseases-4 html

That'a a quote from an article at the address I put at the end of the quote 
The only vaccine in Canada that contains Thamerisol is the flu shot  Ask your doctor    I did

You're right  The more you follow the coarse of this virus and look at other factors like the origional batch of tamiflu being on it's expiration date now  The more this virus starts to look more manufactured than natural 
I don't know for what purpose or really who is benefiting in the end maybe pharmaceutical companies maybe insurance companies I don't know but this whole thing just stinks    kinda like yesterdays fish

at 12:42 PM ETfaithfullyblind your arguments are everything that's wrong with the antivaccine movement and probably the most difficult for medical professionals to handle  I welcome people asking me about thimerosal risks when I'm seeing them in family medicine rotations at my medical school and I enjoy listening to their concerns  However I find their concerns are usually based on false evidence or an overexaggeration of limited evidence and that makes it difficult for me to convince them otherwise  Take your website you quote for example  First of all I can tell the author of that article has no idea what they're talking about based on the fact that they can't even spell basic terms such as Mercury or Petri properly  This immediately lowers their credibility in my eyes  The article is also full of half truths and pseudoscientific claims that have no true basis such as that vaccines cause an inadequate immune system or that they cause autism both of which have been studied extensively and have been disproven 

I'm also fairly certain the study they mention from California where there was a drop in autism when thimerosal was taken out of vaccines is a complete fabrication  I do know of a big study in California that was done a while ago that showed there was NO change in autism rates when thimerosal was taken out of the vaccines  There has also been large well done studies in Scandinavia showing the same thing  I think they author is confused and that confusion has been passed on to you

at 3:08 PM ETThat article was the first link that popped up when I googled thamerisol  I didn't even read it  lol 
Just grabbed the first one there were lots of others to choose from 
I've done a fair amount of digging for information about autism and why it seems to be everywhere within the last couple of years 
The only firm link I've found thus far is Thamerisol  But there is also the arguement of the timing of the 18 month shot  It's a delicate time for the human brain and an important one when it comes to proper developement 
I haven't found any concrete evidence to suggest it's a definate link between that shot and austism outside of my own experience  I got the shot for my son when he was 18 months old  I had to reteach him everything even basic language afterwards  I waited until my daughter was 2 yrs old to get it for her and she's fine 
I know that autism is more common in males which is why I say I haven't found any concrete evidence to point to that shot being catalistic in causing autism  However Mercury is Poison which is why you're not supposed to hold it in your hand even  So I'm not interested in how it's o kay to inject it 
Although I appreciate your effort 
I have some questions for you though since I've got your attention 
Your a certified and licenced doctor?
Where did you study?
Where did the text books you used to study come from?
I'd really like to know the last one because it's my understanding that it's the pharmaceutical companies that write and produce them

at 5:30 PM ETThanks for the reply faithfullyblind  I'm very sorry to hear about the health issues your son had and I'm glad that it sounds like he recovered from his affliction  Autism is a terrible disease and something that I would never wish on any family  I wish we as a scientific community had more answers but the truth is that other than some mild genetic markers we really don't know much about what causes autism  And I know that I obviously wasn't there so far be it from me to tell you what was wrong with your son but as autism is uncurable I'm fairly sure that whatever he had as a child it certainly was not autism  There are many diseases that can mimic autism and they can often be misdiagnosed as autism by doctors and I think it's more likely that your son had one of those conditions  Of course without more of a history there's little more I can say about that 

As for mercury of course it's a poison as is virtually every substance in the universe  There's an old saying in medicine that goes The poison is in the dose since even the ancient Egyptians knew that even water if overconsumed could kill someone  My point is that the mercury in the flu shot is insignificant compared to the amount we're exposed to in our lives and has no measurable health effects as has been measured in countless studies from all over the world  And like you said before and I think is worth mentioning one more time the flu shot is the only shot that still has mercury in it so I hope no one reading this is discouraged from vaccinating their children against other serious diseases  If you're not sure about the mercury content of a vaccine be sure to ask your doctor

at 5:42 PM ETAnd finally to get to your last questions:
-I am not a certified and licensed doctor (yet) but I am a second year medical student who (god-willing) will be licensed in two short years 
-I'm currently studying at an Ontario medical school
- My textbooks are almost all Canadian made although some are American  Textbooks aren't the only way to learn though  When it comes to vaccines I more often learn from reading peer-reviewed scientific literature since a lot of the vaccine-autism debate isn't covered in textbooks  And when it comes to lectures my teachers are bound by the school code of ethics to disclose any funding they receive from pharmaceutical companies and I think that's happened about 3 times in the past 2 years so most of my knowledge is from unbiased sources 

And finally pharmaceutical companies have absolutely nothing to do with writing textbooks  To do so would be a flagrant conflict of interest and the books would never be approved by the school  Textbooks are always written by teams of experts in a field who review eachother's work and make sure it's free from areas of controversy or bias  In fact most books don't even refer to drugs by name but refer to them by class of drug to remove any bias  For example rather than saying Lipitor is used to treat high cholesterol the book would say Statins are used to treat cholesterol thus leaving the choice of which statin to use up to the doctor  Nice try though

at 10:21 PM ETThe thing that gets me is we always get this it's coming it's coming    you better watch out it's coming    however nothing is really materializing out of this as fact 

1) All nations are now no longer testing for H1N1 nor are they reporting the numbers  If this is a pandemic how will they know  It seems that anyone with flu like symptoms will be catergorized as H1N1 and this would be truly misleading 

2) Rushing to put a vaccine into circulation before tests are done  Sure there is the risk that this ounce of prevention could eliminate a pound of cure however we have not seen anything near fatal in this flu  As a matter of fact it is less deadly than H3H5 

3) The US administration grants vaccine immunity to big pharma so that if you grow a third eye or you arms fall of you have no recourse  When did their liability get waived 

4) Most Canadians will not get a shot until flu season is over  Chances are either you contract it or not before then  If you get it and recover you do not need a vaccination at all you will have natural immunity  I wonder if it will be enforced then  Besides how will one know if they had it because no one is testing for it 

5) Why won't they tell us what is in it to the last chemical? I get that on a pack of gum so why not this vaccine  I guess if we knew what was in it we would refuse it wholesale  I can see if this was the mid 16th century when only 10-20% of the population could read but it is 2010 nearly and most of us have the skill 

There just seems to be too many things all happening at once to be coincidence  When you look at the state of the world as a whold from disease to war you can see that things have truly escalated beyond any normal proportion

Seasonal flu which includes a group of flu-like illnesses accounts for as many as 2500 deaths each year in Canada mainly from pneumonia as a complication  For people over the age of 50 the seasonal flu shot may reduce risk more than the swine flu vaccination for those under 50 especially those between 20 and 30 the swine flu shot could be life-saving

=========================

They have always been saying it's coming this fall flu season  Nothing has materialized because wait for it it is summer!

as for you other concerns

1)It seems that anyone with flu like symptoms will be catergorized as H1N1 and this would be truly misleading  ---- Anyone with flu like symptoms will be treated as H1N1 as a precaution (on going now at Canada Summer games) until proven otherwise 

2)H1N1 is less deadly then H3H5? I think you meant H3N5 and it may be more deadly but H1N1 spreads easier (that's the problem  pandemic is based on spreading factor not death factor)   ----your rushed into production comment in #4

3) With the press about some party girls autistic kids gaining popularity people will be blaming baldness brain tumors back hair and stupid kids on vaccines without any proof  Lawsuits costs money even if you win and some judge would rule against science at some point  (they are teaching creationism in texas as science because of a judge unable to comprehend facts)  Creating vaccines would no longer be done by companies because of the liability  We would never again have a vaccine against any disease or flu without that ruling 

4) You are upset we will get the vaccine late but in #2 you want longer trials? Doesn't work both ways  They have been making flu vaccines successfully for some time now so the testing is mainly which preservative hurts the inert virus the least  Think of the flu vaccine as inert virus + preservative 

5) No idea what you are writing about here  last chemical? (long form chemical?)

Seasonal flu which includes a group of flu-like illnesses accounts for as many as 2500 deaths each year in Canada mainly from pneumonia as a complication  For people over the age of 50 the seasonal flu shot may reduce risk more than the swine flu vaccination for those under 50 especially those between 20 and 30 the swine flu shot could be life-saving 
======================================
how on earth could a flu shot be life saving? The drug companies admit the flu shot only gives you protection if they guess the correct strain coming around that year they also admit that they have been wrong six out of the last seven years  See studies that link more than one flu shot with early onset of alzhimers  Its quite simple heavy metals in your brain causes your brain to stop functioning  you might have had to many flu shots to not be able to understand this

One thing that really bothers me about all of this is the incredible self-involvement that drives most people's lack of responsiveness to this  Which is to say that those without underlying conditions aren't so concerned about getting it - though their illness could kill another person who DOES have those underlying conditions  My heart goes out to pregnant women especially - n1n1 is especially destructive for them (it compromises their cardiovascular nervous and respiratory systems)

a bunch of unfounded unproven speculation   

Is this all you are capable of? Seriously is this your lot in life? Troll CBC boards with your words of wisdom? Autism was never heard of until vaccines? Wow are you serious? The term was not even coined until 1940's that does not mean it did not exist miracle mind it simply didnt have a definition at that point    I suppose still born is a new thing too we can blame on vaccines because we did not label that untill the 19th century too  But I guess because I don't agree with your views of paranoia that I am a 'schill' and a 'pharma apologist' 

It's a real shame you present your ideas in the way that you do because I think there is a lot of validity in your core ideas that do need to be though about and brought into question  The unfortunate part is your ideas and theories get overshadowed by your desperate wanting to convince people instead of giving them something to think about

at 2:03 PM ETWhat Squalene Does to Rats

Oil-based vaccination adjuvants like squalene have been proved to generate concentrated unremitting immune responses over long periods of time [vi]

A 2000 study published in the American Journal of Pathology demonstrated a single injection of the adjuvant squalene into rats triggered “chronic immune-mediated joint-specific inflammation” also known as rheumatoid arthritis [vii]

The researchers concluded the study raised questions about the role of adjuvants in chronic inflammatory diseases 

What Squalene Does to Humans

Your immune system recognizes squalene as an oil molecule native to your body  It is found throughout your nervous system and brain  In fact you can consume squalene in olive oil and not only will your immune system recognize it you will also reap the benefits of its antioxidant properties 

The difference between “good” and “bad” squalene is the route by which it enters your body  Injection is an abnormal route of entry which incites your immune system to attack all the squalene in your body not just the vaccine adjuvant

A study conducted at Tulane Medical School and published in the February 2000 issue of Experimental Molecular Pathology included these stunning statistics:

“ … the substantial majority (95%) of overtly ill deployed GWS patients had antibodies to squalene  All (100%) GWS patients immunized for service in Desert Shield/Desert Storm who did not deploy but had the same signs and symptoms as those who did deploy had antibodies to squalene 

In contrast none (0%) of the deployed Persian Gulf veterans not showing signs and symptoms of GWS have antibodies to squalene  Neither patients with idiopathic autoimmune disease nor healthy controls had detectable serum antibodies to squalene  The majority of symptomatic GWS patients had serum antibodies to squalene ”[xi]

The first case of autism occurred in 1943 in America twelve years after a mercury-containing preservative thimerosal was added to the whooping cough (pertussis) vaccine  In the 1950s with only four recommended vaccines the incidence of autism was 1 in 10000 children 

As more vaccines were recommended the incidence of autism increased dramatically  By 1981 children received 135 micrograms of mercury in vaccines  The incidence of autism increased to 1 in 2600 children  Children in 1996 received 246 micrograms of mercury in vaccines and the incidence of autism was about 1 in every 350 children 

Today 13 vaccines are recommended with varying numbers of booster shots  The number of shots ranges from 50 to over 100 in some areas  The incidence of autism now averages about 1 in every 150 children by some estimates and shows little evidence of decline 

Children who receive vaccinations containing thimerosal have six times the amount of autism as those who received a vaccine free of thimerasol  The majority of autism symptoms begin after a vaccination

That is somewhat true in so far as it's helped sell drugs but talk to any teacher that has 30 or 40 years under their belt and they'll tell you kids are very different these days and not in a good way  My mom taught grades 1-4 for almost 5 decades and she laughed when I pulled that argument out at the dinner table  Vaccines perhaps but whatever it is she has no doubt children are mentally and chemically different 

You can get some vaccines without mercury but then they've replaced it with aluminum  Squalenes are being fast tracked past the usual pediatric protocols for the flu vaccine  Here's an FDA transcript of the hearing:

There is no reason to suspect that not administering Tamiflu to your child would lead to seizure by Child Protective Services  This articles says that Tamiflu has been approved for use in infants not that it is mandatory 

Pharmaceutical companies make trillions of dollars from children? Can you back those numbers up?

While I don't think that giving children medication is always in their best interest I also don't think it's in the best interest of children to have paranoid parents with zero literacy in science  I don't know if we should be thanking our lucky stars that the government can't reprimand parents for being morons 

You claim that trauma began once the government stepped in but that sounds like nonsense to me  Some kids really are abused by their parents or other family members and sometimes the government is justified to step in  If you want to blame everything wrong with kids on the government and pharmaceutical companies then tone down your ignorant paranoia and make reasonable arguments

Media outlets do this thing called 'News' and contrary to your belief    a global pandemic that is killing people and that we have no immunity to is actually considered newsworthy  While I certainly won't argue that the media feeds off of fear and helps generate more fear it is still simply reporting news At the start of all this they reported on anything and everything are you suggesting they do not do this with any and every major news story that has ever happened? I kinda think it does    Editors pick and chose what stories will sell to the general public be that swine flu vaccine is not out for 2 more days or a feel good story about a one legged girl climbing a tree to rescue a cat 

Right now a swine flu story would be known as a filler story so if it's a slow day and nobody cool has died and the US is not blowing up someone they will turn to an easy sell H1N1 story  Why must we apply hidden agendas to everything?

at 1:05 AM ETWell as far as I remember there was some warning a few years ago about Tamiflu in children but mostly for short term (during the course of the prescription) psychiatric nature ( not a permanent damage to the body and vomiting and nausea (also in adults)  These adverse effects in children were only reported in Japan  There were twelve deaths but see below from the U S  Food and Drugs Administration:

http://www fda gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/ucm107840 htm

QUOTE

Review of the available information on the safety of Tamiflu in pediatric patients suggests that the increased reports of neuropsychiatric events in Japanese children are most likely related to an increased awareness of influenza-associated encephalopathy increased access to Tamiflu in that population and a coincident period of intensive monitoring adverse events  Based on the information available to us we can not conclude that there is a causal relationship between Tamiflu and the reported pediatric deaths

at 1:16 AM ETI have objected in the past to several pharma apologists who quote me out of context  There is reason for that  The meaning is completely different in the wrong context 

Take this news story as an example  Read it carefully again  It was not for general prescription to babies for seasonal flu  It is for emergency use  Perhaps the journalist could have made it clearer because the actual document is here:

Interim Guidance for emergency use of oseltamivir (Tamiflu® ) In children under one year of age in the context of 2009 (H1N1) pandemic

http://www phac-aspc gc ca/alert-alerte/swine-porcine/guidance-orientation-07-20-eng php

So no need to get overly excited  The option is needed by doctors should the need arise - in cases where the baby is tested positive for H1N1 and delayed treatment may lead to catastrophic outcome such as death

at 1:42 AM ETThere is a prevalence of encephalopathy associated with flu in Japanese children  Tamiflu is also known to be over prescribed in Japan in the early days of Tamiflu introduction resulting in resistance  It appears that some of the prescriptions were not even necessary or useful  See this paper:

Oseltamivir treatment for children showing abnormal behavior during influenza virus infection

QUOTE

Conclusions: Our observations suggest that oseltamivir is not a prerequisite for the development of abnormal behavior and does not worsen the clinical manifestations of abnormal behaviors although further investigations are needed to determine whether oseltamivir is necessary or even useful for patients with influenza virus encephalopathy 

END QUOTE

Even though there is no conclusive causal evidence as a precaution it is still correct to use Tamiflu for infants ONLY in emergency as in the context of swine flu H1N1 pandemic hospitalizations with over 2 days of symptoms

When I ask someone to back up their claim it's because I find their claim hard to believe  That's totally different that actively claiming the opposite  If someone such as you really thinks that Tamiflu might be ineffective then why not just answer the question?

My own opinion unless you test positive for H1N1 leave the drugs alone  And certainly if at all possible keep them away from our children  I'm glad that it is available in emergency situations for our children but am even more relieved that they are not (yet) putting this forward as a normal course of action

You mention research so could you at least point to research that helped lead you to this conclusion or at least briefly explain your point of view?

Honestly just saying that the information is out there tells me nothing other than that you think you're right and hope that I'll believe that your opinion is based on evidence and reliable information  Since you don't tell me where your information is coming from I'm still left right where I started with the same basic question that I always ask Why do you believe that what you're saying is true?

One of the major concerns some have are questionable ethics by pharmaceuticals in falsifying harmful side-effects to get their product approved & used 

Case in point ~ a female Cdn doctor who publicly voiced concerns about side-effects in clinical studies she was doing ~ threatened with a lawsuit by the pharmaceutical sponsor 

Then blogger brucecification 12:26PM 07/19/09 post about the French gov't actions against GlaxoSmithKline for possible criminal misconduct regarding their anti-Hepatitis B vaccine distributed between 1994 and 1998  If I'm not mistaken GSK will be the Cdn supplier of our H1N1 vaccine 

For those apprehensive about safety safeguards being compromised in the name of profitability / posturing [by pharmaceuticals & N A  gov't] read The Virus Within - A Coming Epidemic by Cdn/US medical journalist Nicholas Regush  It addresses the Aids Scam successfully implemented on an ignorant & naive public 

Then there's Austrian journalist Jane Burgermeister's FBI lawsuit implicating WHO / UN / others of possible bioterrorism   Like something out of a Hollywood script! Yet strange things have been known to happen ~ like the massive fraud schemes perpetuated on Wall Street that affected banks / brokerage & mortgage firms / investors [worldwide] that led to the current economic global crisis 

Welcome to the brave new world or reside in your “glass bubble” and delude yourself to think these are all “ridiculous conspiracy theorist logic” and “not the fact that people make money” [through fraud / unsafe product manufacture]

I also don't think there's much difference between making decisions based upon a coin toss and making decisions based upon strong negative feelings    health decisions should be based upon an informed comparison of the possible benefits of treatment versus the potential detriments  I can see though that based upon the reaction to my first post a lot of the people who track health articles on CBC are not interested in hearing both sides of any medical argument  Resistance to modern medicine seems like more of a religious movement than anything else    logic based on belief always trumps logic based on facts

Well garet    I am normally on your side of the hat but this headline H1N1 vaccine in babies worries expert kinda brings your points into question  For me this has never been a tinfoil hat debate where they are all trying to kill us it does however make any logically thinking person question the basic idea of taking an adjuvenated vaccine that even the experts are concerned over  Concerned enough to not want to give it to pregnant mothers  Then after stating that they are telling us to give it to a baby - 5 years old even though they admit that they do not know how it will react with them 

You have to be a moron not to put that together and question why on earth would ANYONE do that to their child? I mean if 3000 children have died from it in the world sure okay I could see the need for the rush and the risk but 76 have died in total and many of them were not kids and many were sick before hand 

So i pose the question directly to you    why should I risk my childs health on something you can't tell me is safe because it has not been tested on something that thus far is mainly mild?

With this one step I have lost complete faith in their decision making  They risk too much to quickly for a reason I can't see and they have yet to show me 

An adjuvinated vaccine is only good for the short term to get enough to everyone and only 1 dose  Short term actions have long term consequences

RE: Squalene adjuvants being used in safely Europe she writes:

A powerful immune reaction may be excellent for the elderly whose immune systems weaken considerably with age  Remember MF59 has only been licensed overseas for use in flu vaccines for those over 65 years of age  Presumed safety in this age group cannot be extrapolated to the young  There is no evidence of MF59's safety in young adults and especially in children

at 12:52 AM ETWe'll be very very confident about the adjuvanted vaccine which we know in addition to providing some better immunity appears to provide longer-lasting immunity in previous trials as well as protection against drift or changes in the virus itself Dr  David Butler-Jones Canada's chief public health officer said Wednesday 

The study Butler-Jones is referring to is summarized here on a GSK press release:
http://www redorbit com/news/health/860243/new_studies_indicate_gsks_prepandemic_influenza_vaccine_can_protect_against/index html

So basically the federal government's rationale for wanting to vaccinate millions of Canadians including vulnerable babies and children with an adjuvanted flu vaccine -- instead of the unadjuvanted kind that regulators know from decades of experience works safely and well -- is predicated on a single study of 400 people many of whom weren't given the adjuvant at all  The study didn't even test H1N1 vaccine it was for H5N1 - bird flu 

I'm tired of the suggestion that if I refuse to accept blanket assurances about the safety of this vaccine I must be some kind of anti-vaccine kook  Actually I'm fully vaccinated and so are my children 

Just give Canadians the option to choose between adjuvanted vaccine or the regular kind  It's a no brainer

This is not fearmongering this is not tin foil hat web sites - to me this is common sense  I alike it to a new model car certainly they have been making cars forever and they are very safe    but with each new model comes a large set of recalls normally just because there is slight variances in the new model  I avoid new models because I don't want the headaches that come with recalls  In a new model of vaccine the recall could be more than a faulty transmission    prove to me it wont harm my 5 year old  I dont need to prove to you it wont

The WHO is a very reputable organization  While individual reaction to this may be blown out of proportion the fact remains - this is NOT one of the many other flu strains we battle each year

You do a disservice to your children if you don't give them a vaccine that can prevent serious illness  You also do a disservice to your infants too young to receive this vaccine if you do not get it yourself - you are the only thing protecting them from this flu

And I never claimed otherwise  What I did write was that international studies have indicated that this is safe and made no claims to the scope or limitations of those studies  I also wrote encouraging adults to be inoculated although it is likely that this vaccine is just as safe as others we have used for other causes  This was not created in isolation but rather rides on some extremely well-understood science  The fact that the director of a private lab (in Canada) that happens to test vaccines for children (in Canada) thinks that this vaccine should be further tested (in Canada) (note the rather pointed interest he has in this) prior to release is not a reason to assume that it is unsafe if no other country produces results that challenge the safety of this drug in infants  Is there value in broader studies?

_________

According to the Alberta Pandemic Plan containing recommendations which has been ignored by our faithful leaders the seasonal flu kills about 17 people per year  So we are beyond that 

I'd like to know how many of the recently deceased had underlying conditions and were not offered the vaccine due to the colossal screw up of the government  Perhaps some lawsuits will straighten these imbeciles out

How do you define regular flu? Do you know how many different flu viruses exist? It is meaningless to compare the death toll of all other flu viruses to H1N1  It is only meaningful to compare one flu virus to another

Have you people done ANY research on this topic?

Pandemic H1N1 IS the regular flu this year 

Have you been to an influenze surveilance website? have you LOOKED at stats? or do you just repeat what you've heard from others?

Right now in Alberta we are in week 4 of the flu season 

By week 3 of the flu season Oct 25-31 we've had 3685 CONFIRMED cases (tested and typed) cases of Influenza A and 0 -- ZERO B 

H1N1 is part of A and it makes up for 97 7% of of the A diagnoses 

For anyone who still doesn't want to read the stats - IF YOU GET THE FLU YOU ARE GOING TO GET H1N1  It's the only flu out there in Canada right now 

Also beyond the tested and confirmed cases of flu  The clinically diagnosed (meidcal offices emergency depts cases are up oh - about 1000% from last year  However this is probably due to WAY more people getting scared and running to the ER when they have the flu 

Anyway  to all you people who wish to learn somthing rather than join into pointless rabid rhetoric  Go read our Flu statistics

my mistake i wasnt informed when drug companies started working for free and doing thier jobs jsut to help out others  perhaps you need to learn how to think 

you order in some lumber to build your house you realize you dont have enough nails do finish the job so instead of getting more nails you tell the lumber yard its ok to sell the lumber to your neighbour instead as he wants some wood too and that even though the wood belongs to you you let the lumber company keep the extra proceeds  by the time you get around to building your house the price of wood has went up so you gladly pay more for your wood and you dont mind sleeping in your tent in the -40 because you didnt really want that new house anyways

Which would make Alberta's share somewhere around 250-500 per year   far above the numbers who've so far died from H1N1 
And per capita these figures are very close to what the CDC (Centre for Disease Control) quote for the United States

Well in this time period 99% of the flu cases have been H1N1 and the fatality rate of each flu is about the same 0 1%  That would suggest about 6 hospitalization cases of seasonal flu and of those 6 cases 0 1% of them died  That's 0 006 deaths due to seasonal flu  Lets round that off to ZERO

When are you people going to wake up and understand that 'if' H1N1 was a stationary happening then very few people would argue that it's a mild event  Influenza is NOT stationary  It evolves  While we wait on pins and needles to hear what the who's reason for the delay on the results from the Ukraine is    by all means laugh it up  Things are starting to look like they are going to become real -real quick

Some employers are even giving paid time off if you are diagnosed H1N1 so there is plenty of motivation to say you have H1N1 when in fact it might just be the ordinary bothersome flu

at 5:09 PM ETThere seems to be many sites quoting Corriveau/Alberta Health stating Alberta's average death toll from seasonal influenza @ about 20-30 

Additionally I can find 3 references to both '17' and '26' as the average annual flu deaths over the past decade - which seems reasonable - Alberta's population was noticably smaller more than 10 years ago 

There are a few articles (like posters here) that chose to factor Canada's annual flue death rates (4-8K) multiplied by Alberta's % of Canada's population and coming up with a 250 - 400 figure    this is perhaps the WORST calculation method    All provinces (and their populations/death rates/sickness demographics etc) are very different 

Alberta's average age is lowest of all provinces  More than 5 years younger than Newfoundland for example 

And do you really think that with living conditions in Nunavut as they are that you could extrapolate data from their statistics and 'apply' it to say those living in North Vancouver!?!?!

Also some really high risk patients won't be able to attend mass vaccination clinics and it would be nice if AHS could arrange for them to get their shots if they want them

at 12:40 PM ETI want to know what the health board was thinking when they came up with who and how people were going to be vaccinated first  Being the parent of a chronically ill child we had to wait in the cold for hours before making it into the room full of screaming sick kids  Our daughter is trached with a rare chromosome defect she has a neurological disorder on Oxygen 24 hours a day and cannot manage her own secreations  We cannot bring her out in public places because she can pick up germs so easily but yet they could not come into our home to give the vaccine? She only qualified because she was in the age group NOT because she is chronically ill  We have workers that come into our home because she has to be on 24 hour care but these workers did not qualify for the vaccine nor did we as parents!! WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE?

The CDC needs to make a stand and make this vaccine mandatory for children under 18   Take the decision out of the hands of the negligent parents   God knows with the foolish comments by the naysayers some children will be at risk

It's become painfully obvious that no lessons were ever learned by Health Canada to help prepare for a viral outbreak  If lessons were learned they've since been forgotten  You don't even have to look back that far to see scares like SARS and the avian flu that should have helped to prepare us for how we would handle a nationwide vaccination program to combat H1N1 (or whatever came along) 

No wonder a high percentage of the population are wary about receiving the vaccine  What has our health system done lately that would give them any reassurance that this situation is under control? Every day our government just keeps adding fuel to the fire these anti-vaccination conspiracy theorists warm their collective a$$es by 

I read another comment from a related H1N1 vaccination bungle story where the author said something to the effect that all this entire debacle has shown her/him was that if we ever really got hit by an organism that could wreak some real havoc we'd be screwed

What does any of this story have to do with an individual's decision to get vaccinated?

If you actually read the story you'll discover that the issue is miscalculation of needed doses at specific clinics coupled with each provincial health system's fluxuating priority list leaving people wondering if they are even eligible for the shot 

The story also talks about trying to get unused shots to clinics that have run out of the shot and have a number of people still waiting  Yep sounds like the masses silently standing up to send the message of refusal to vaccinate to me

CBC needs to review the role it has played in this entire H1N1 issue 

They have missed their job entirely 

CBC is our national broadcaster - they are heavily subsidized by the taxpayer - you and me  This gives them a bigger set of responsibilities:

In times of national crisis they become more than a news organization 

In times of national crisis they should be playing a key role as part of the solution 

In times of national crisis they become the national conduit for timely factual and trusted information tailored to every part of the country 

But this hasn't been the case 

Without a doubt CBC and its national broadcast coverage has done more to escalate paranoia around this issue and create mass confusion around the vaccination rollout than any other single agency 

Local issues reported out of context and broadcast as nationwide news do nothing but create misunderstanding confusion frustration anger and fear 

Arguably this H1N1 crisis may not have been a crisis at all - but it is unquestionably a heck of a trial run - and CBC needs to discover its real role as a responsible national broadcaster before an actual crisis ever hit

To the poster who made the comment about nurses being lazy and uncaring; it is this type of attitude that makes me so angry  I have put in hours of overtime these last few weeks which I will not be compensated for in order that my patients (who are my neighbours and friends in this small community we live in) are taken care of  We had 2 hours warning that we we getting the vaccination last week and we put together a clinic in that short period of time that afternoon  And then we came in the next day a Saturday to ensure all the vaccinations were used and not wasted  I called people from my home until 10:30 at night to ensure people knew 
Yes there has been some really poor planning and implimentation but don't label the nurses and doctors lazy because you don't understand all the details

From The Calgary Herald 13 Nov 09: The new guidelines come as Alberta announced five additional deaths related to H1N1 Thursday bringing the total number of fatalities in the province to 34 since the strain first appeared in the spring 

Please get your facts straight

Considering the haste with which this program was put together it would be most unrealistic to expect there to be no wastage  Armchair quarterback comments notwithstanding perfection is impossible in the real world 

That said the entire program seems to have been badly handled across the nation  As an example Calgary with polls suggesting 500000 people would want it opened four clinics with a daily capacity of 2000 each 

Hopefully this will serve as a wakeup call with procedures at all levels being examined in case we ever get hit with something really nasty  I note the feds are changing the sole-source deal for vaccines

at 10:26 PM ETFor those complaining about the wastage I don't see it as all that significant 
This vaccine as I understand it differs from seasonal flu vaccine which is provided in single shots  This vaccine is a multi shot so it has to be mixed and divided into ten doses  If 100 shots are mixed and only 99 people show up that day one shot gets tossed out  There's your 1% wastage 

Would you prefer that the medical authorities take a chance on keeping the unused doses longer than 24 hours and injecting people with possibly contaminated vaccine? or tell the 9 people who show up for the last 10 shots to go away and come back the next day so you can have do a full 10 vaccinations out of the vial? In the circumstances a slight wastage seems the preferable alternative

at 11:48 PM ETWatching this story on the news and reading about it on this site and other site it would seem that there is a misconception that the vaccine's best before date is expired  The vaccine is good until next year if not opened  It is only when the vial is opened and mixed with the adjuvant that the 24 hour clock starts ticking down  There are 10 adult doses per vial in the supply our clinic received  I understand that the public health received larger vials with more doses per vial  Our clinic only mixes up a new vial once we have enough people lined up and we can ensure that all the doses will be used within the 24 hours  We can control this in a family practice  This would be impossible to do in a public health clinic setting  The nurses will mix up the new vials as long as there are people in line  but there is no way to get exactly the right amount of people to use up every dose in that last vial mixed in the day 
Can you imagine the outrage if people were getting turned away because there wasn't enough people behind them to make it worth while to open up a new vial? Sorry folks you have to leave so we don't waste any vaccine

your odds of having the flu and being dignosed with h1n1: about 1 3 in 10

at 12:55 AM ETI really don't see this wastage as being that big a deal  Regular flu vaccine comes in single shots so there's no problem there  This vaccine comes in multiple dosages so one vial gets mixed into 10 doses  If the clinic makes up 100 doses but only 99 people come in then 1 dose is going to be thrown out  There's your 1% 

What are the other options? Keep that 100th dose for the next day use it and possibly inject someone with contaminated vaccine? Or send the last 9 patients home for the day rather than mix up another batch and tell them to come back in the morning? In the circumstances a little wastage seems by far the better choice

The 50 4 million doses of adjuvanted could have been 12 6 million doses of unadjuvanted H1N1 vaccine  Add 1 8 million that GSK shipped to Canada 0 2 million unadjuvanted doses from CSL Australia that's 14 6 million doses of unadjuvanted  Then add the 7 6 million doses of unadjuvanted going to the U S  and we know we could have 22 2 million doses of unadjuvanted vaccine for Canada  We won't even be able to find that many Canadians taking the shot

at 12:18 PM ETFrom the article:
***
One possibility being considered is that the Mexican victims may have had underlying medical conditions that made them more susceptible to the bug 
***

Another possibility that should be considered is that there are far more people in Mexico therefore it's statistically likely that more people are going to become ill from the introduction of the same pathogen  It should also be noted that Mexico does not have anywhere near the same level of access to healthcare services or even to basic human needs (clean drinking water uncontaminated food) that Canada has so it's much more likely that illnesses there even something so common as say the flu will have a much more significant effect on their population 
So it should come as absolutely no surprise just on the question of sheer numbers and quality-of-life issues that the influenza virus does more damage in Mexico than in Canada  In fact that's probably the reality every single year whether it's caused by swine flu or not 
Oh and to the other panicky people out there - it's called swine flu because pigs can get it  In fact they can actually catch it from us  That's all  It's influenza pretty much like any other  If you cook your pork (which is something else that not all Mexican citizens do) the flu virus will be killed

Of course another factor to consider is that the Temperature in Mexico right now will not be seen in most of NA for another 2 months  If this viral strain a atypical and thrives in heat this may be a very rough summer

at 12:57 PM ET1) The H1N1 flu virus is just that  A flu virus that is resilient to regular vacinations and treatments  Like any other virus it can mutate into a different strain or variation and have very different effects 

2) Margie69: 42 people have died in Mexico not 20  When making a comment about the insensitivity of the media and their not researching the facts maybe you sould read the article to make sure YOU have all the facts first 

3) People die of complications related to the flu every year mostly the elderly and infants  If a person's immune system is weakened then they are more suseptable to illness of ANY kind meaning there is a greater chance of complication (this is the reason health units insist on having the elderly vacinated against the flu on a yearly basis as well as those with compromised immune systems)  It takes time to research 42 people's medical history and then compare them to the other 1516 cases in 22 countries  Not to mention that there are privacy laws that differe in each of these countries regarding medical history 

4) The reason people are worried about this virus is because it's spreading very fast and currently has no cure  It was the same thing with the Avian flu  If everyone takes the proper percautions (frequent hand washing avoid close contact with anyone that appears sick and/or has travelled to Mexico and consult a doctor at the first signs of illness) most people should be ok  Some will still get sick but the majority will be fine

Who would have imagined that?

Is it possible that Mexico doesn't know how many cases it has and is only seeing the worse cases?
Is it possible that Mexican health care is at a lower standard for the masses than in Canada?

at 1:12 PM ETSo geniuses doing the grade five math it would appear that the mortality rate is approximately 1 per 200 infections or about half of one percent 

So the fewer people that contract the virus the fewer will die 

There are 33000000 people in Canada so if we all caught it we might expect oh someplace around 150000 deaths give or take a few thousand 

Those are the facts  It does not take an expert to do the grade 5 math 

Now as far as those experts who are saying wash your hands and cough into your sleeves and go about your business - clearly they have not done the math and are simply trying to prevent Canadians from panicking and perhaps doing things that might harm the economy while saving their lives  After all it's all about the money honey not your lives 

It will be very interesting to track the numbers of people in Canada who catch this piggy flu  Here are my predictions 

when the infections reach 1000 we will have lost 5 people
when the infections reach 100000 we will have lost 500 people
when the infections reach 1000000 we will have lost 5000 people
and so on

Alternately perhaps N  Americans are more often exposed to flu viruses and their immune systems respond to it more quickly and effectively 

TimBitzz: It's swine virus whether you like it or not  Regardless during this outbreak I continue to eat pork (whether chops sausage loin roasts or bacon)  But that's only because I'm educated and informed and I know that consuming the meat _can't_ propagate the virus 

The point here is that by masking the truth under a label does not change anything  The best recourse is not mis-information or concealing the facts but a MORE informed public who know the difference between swine virus propagation and eating pork

Mary   The likelihood Mexico knowing just how many people have this flu is remote at best     rework you equation like this:
1 per 200 X = ?%

Considering Mexico City has one of the largest populations of any city on the face of the planet    I think that's a larger LARGE X

Remember to consider the human factor in all this  There are other things to consider when looking at the possibility of a virus outbreak that could be globaly detrimental  Like things that others have mentioned such as environmental climate nourishment cultural ethnic genetic or biological  It's not black and white and that's what the doctors AROUND THE WORLD are trying to figure out 

And the experts are right  One of the best ways to guard against a virus like the flu is to remove as much bacteria/germs from your daily lives (say by washing your hands regularily) and avoiding exposing others (by coughing into your sleve because coughing into your hand and then touching a doornob defeats the purpose of covering your mouth as you just transmitted those germs onto a solid surface others will touch) 

As well has anyone heard of the kid in Mexico that is the Patient 0 in this case?? He's not even sick  We don't know much about this strain (like the incubation period) and that is why the histeria is starting  People fear the unknown and when the people who deal with this stuff for a living don't know it's concerning for anyone who pays attention

Perhaps you should have given up math in grade four? 1900 people in 22 countries have been reportedly infected with H1N1 and to date 44 have died includiing 42 in Mexico one Mexican citizen visiting the US and one US citizen  The math is indeed simple but doesn't come close to reflecting your idea that in each country the death toll is 1 in 200  Remember 43 Mexicans have died out of roughly 1200 citizens confirmed infected  1 US citizen has died with roughly 400 cases of infection and 0 citizens of the other 20 countries have died with some 300 world citizens infected 

Grade 6 math says the death toll in Mexico is 1 in 28 the death toll in the US is 1 in 400 while the remainder of the world is 0 out of 300

So we're told it is possible that a virus of questionable infectiousness and virulence can survive through the meat processing steps that occur from farm to packaging  Though no expert I would expect this to be very unlikely given the amount of time between any infection testing slaughter freezing storage and consumption 

I really hope the CFIA chooses not to cull the herd in this case  The fact that all the pigs have or are recovering means that they will soon not only be free of the virus they will have new antibodies against it 

Animals just like us get sick from time to time and they either recover or they don't  I'm sure over the years I've eaten meat that came from an animal that got sick at some point in its life

Of course there are terrible financial implications if the government introduces any doubt about food safety  I do feel for the pork producers who have done nothing to deserve this  That said the public deserves the truth which is probably something like: There is a theoretical chance that swine flu could be passed from a sick animal to a person from the person consuming the meat of the animal  In order for that to happen a sick animal has to be slaughtered (possible) and the food preparation has to be sub-standard (very possible)

Sick swine are not knowingly slaughtered and processed for consumption but do they send samples to the CDC for testing before selling it?--Just like humans sick swine may not display observable symptoms for a few days  Do you know where the pork you purchase in your local supermarket is raised and slaughtered and packaged? How do you know where it's from---maybe Alberta? Would you still eat it if you knew it came from Mexico?

As I said yesterday common sense dictates that you use proper SAFE food handling / cross contamination avoidance techniques  Do you not wash your kitchen utensils? Do you not sterlize the surfaces on which you cut meat? Do you not wash your hands after handling raw meat and before touching anything else? If you don't then eating pork is the LEAST of your worries 

As an aside the implements used (pot pan baking dish) used in the actual cooking of the meat are irrelevant as they themselves are heated well above the temperature that would kill the virus

I get a kick out of these self proclaimed experts on this  Phone your local veterinarian and ask their opinion  Pork is safe and always will be in Canada  We take pride in growing it we are not fly-by-night farmers this is what we as farmers want to do for many more years to come and work hard each day to send a quality product to the market for everyone to enjoy  Trust me we do everything in our power to make pork safe and I have total confidence that it is safe for anyone to eat

Veggies can kill same as meat  I wish I could remember the name of it but a friend of mine a few years ago got some condition caused by eating carrots that were not washed properly He was in the hospital for over a week

at 5:57 PM EThemerkid You forget the history behind today's meat eating society 

Let me tell you a story years and years ago before your parents and your parents parents were born we had cavemen and cavewomen  They would spend their time and energy looking for food and could only gather plants and vegetables in small doses having to repeat the process daily  This was considered to be a waste of time when they discovered that a small amount of meat could give as much energy as the food fetched during the daily plant and vegetable excursions  This was the start to what I call “The Great Laziness” slaughtering animals for meat and perhaps the start of an evolutionary process 

Now your point of view relates more to our digestive systems not having adapted properly to be able to digest these animals/meats thus the increase in cancers digestive disorders and diseases  Our intestines being longer than most natural meat eaters’ cause meat to rot create gas and over the years disease 

Long live meats always part of a balanced diet

My point is about Agriculture Canada and the conflict between public interest and corporate profits
Don't get me wrong it's not that you can't handle tainted meat safely It's that people won't handle it properly  The sick animals should be destroyed and burned  There are cross contamination issues and the simple fact that accidents happen  say someone has a cut and gets bio fluid transfer from some infected pork 
Remember how well Maple Leaf Foods handled the Listeria problem?

In the article it alludes that its safe to handle infected meat  It is not unless you wear gloves etc until its cooked then sterilize all non stainless surfaces with bleach    Why take the chance that some farmer passed a sick animal to the slaughterhouse  At the slaughterhouse the Inspectors are doing tests for known pathogens in a place far far away from any sick animals  It's the whole farming practice/ distribution that's wrong because of cost cutting practices  Personally I'm going to eat more beef for a while

I have no idea who these bunch of doctors and scientists who are being responsible and cautionary you are referring to are--have any names or numbers of those doctors and scientists? But if you actually paid attention and listened to a legitimate doctor or scientist you might have learned something  Such as the only possible way you could get a virus from eating pork was if you ate it raw from a pig that actually had this flu or died from it 
You and many others may or may not know that sick animals are not slaughtered for food in Canada or most other countries

I see the point you are making here and share your disdain of politicians as well however unfortunately in this case the Ag minister is correct  The only numbskulls are those that believe H1N1 (Swine Influenza virus) can be transmitted through ingestion 

When I hear my peers colleagues and people out in the street as well as people who write on these forums speak and/or write with fear of how they think they will get H1N1 from eating pork it leads me to believe that there must be an absolutely alarming statistic that describes the number of Canadians who lack fundamental knowledge in basic microbiology virology genetics and even general biology and science in general  Maybe more stimulus money should be invested in these areas as I find some of these false and paranoid statements to be disturbing 

The pork of the matter is that you CANNOT get swine flu by eating bacon!

Also the WHO the CDC and the FDA in the US the NML and Health Canada here at home and all of other major health-care and medical policy institutions and regulatory authorities and federal governments of the world have acted so fast and effectively and we have more anti-viral stockpiles today than ever before in history so everyone should remain calm 

The Spanish Influenza of 1918 - 1920 killed 30 million people in 14 days and between 70 - 100 million people between 1918 - 1920  To put this into perspective Spanish Influenza killed ~17X as many people as the Holocaust in less than 1/2 of the time-span  Now THAT is a real global pandemic and something to be afraid of 

The swine flu (H1N1) however does not contain or contains the same genes encoding the virulence factors of the Spanish flu or they are partially deleted mutated and / or otherwise silenced / inactive making them still infective and contagious but not anywhere close to as rampant and deadly as the the 1918 - 1920 viral strain

at 1:25 AM ETThere are 3 types of Influenza virus (all of which are RNA viruses belonging to the viral family known as Orthomyxoviridae):

H7N7 H1N2 H9N2 H7N2 H7N3 and H10N7 )
2  avian influenza (H5N1)
3  swine influenza (H1N1)

The H = hemagglutinin (a surface glycoprotein) and the N = neuraminidase (an enzyme that cleaves glycosidic linkages on neuraminic acid) 

With the all of the above stated it is worth nothing that there are some common unifying properties of the Influenza viruses chief among which is that they all are transmitted almost EXCLUSIVELY (despite extremely rare reported instances of transmission via saliva blood etc ) via aerosols from coughing sneezing etc  and form primary infections of the respiratory system (esp  the lungs) which often leads to pneumonia which may lead to death in extreme cases  With H1N1 in mind it is absolutely critical that one understands that pork has nothing to do with getting swine flu 

Touching raw pig meat eating raw pig meat (why would anyone do this anyways?) handling raw pig meat or their blood etc  and touching/handling/eating cooked pig meat all are unrelated to swine flu transmission and you absolutely will NOT develop pneumonia if you simply throw a raw pork chop on the barbecue 

Unless a pig coughs or sneezes on you or someone who inhaled the viral aerosol of H1N1 from a pig that sneezed / coughed on them sneezes or coughs on you who then does this to someone else who in turn does this to someone else etc  you will NOT get the swine flu  Everyone should just settle down

The infected herd in Alberta needs to be destroyed and incinerated and the farmer compensated for his losses  That is the only way we can demonstrate to the world that we are proactive about swine flu  It simply doesn't matter if this herd recovers and the animals are safe by any scientific standard  If consumers in our hog markets have doubts that's all that counts on the bottom line  We might as well stuff the scientific evidence up our butts because it means nothing to frightened foreign consumers that can buy their pork from other countries

at 9:41 AM ETGet used to this story: Large numbers of farmers leaving agriculture  Almost all of our farms constantly balance on the edge of profitably and loss  And when loss occurs it usually results in huge bills and bankruptcy  There are almost no young farmers and who can blame young people for not farming - its just so much easier to make a living doing almost anything else 

Consider this statistic - 75% of current Canadian farmers are due to retire in the next decade and most have no planned successor 

I expect this forum will soon fill with posts attacking big corporate farms and extolling small sustainable farms although most of the small farms people have in mind are really hobby or life-style farms where folks have full-time off-farm jobs or some sort of pension  You can buy their goods at a farmers market and feel you're supporting local agriculture 

If we are to feed the 30 million or so folks in Canada we'll need our share of full-time farms producing more than just local comfort food for the well-heeled 

When our farm was hobby-sized everyone loved us and told us we were what farming was supposed to be about  It was a great ego stroke  Unfortunately we decided to make farming our full-time job and expanded to where we could try to make farming our sole source of income  Our farm is no longer small and cute and it's hard to watch teachers and university professors folks who don't really have to worry about how much money they make from farming spend their summers selling their goods at the farmer's market and cashing in on the local food fad 

We need to find ways to help farmers make a good respectable living from farming  Sustainable farming most include the concept of economic sustainability for farmers if we are to have any real farms left

at 1:22 PM ETHi tarsengreen

We grow corn and soybeans as well as raising livestock (sheep) however to make enough money to support our family by solely growing crops we would need to work about 10000 acres (this is about what a number of my cash-cropping friends and neighbors find they have to work in order to make a modest living)  Land values for good (class 1 or class 2) land range from $2500 - $6000 an acre in Ontario  Obviously owning that much land is cost-prohibitive but even finding enough land to lease is very difficult 

We farm just over 700 acres owned and leased  Some in pasture with the best land in crop production  We couldn't afford the extra land right now if we had to get out of livestock farming  We've also been looking for additional land in our area about another 200 acres to buy or lease in order to grow extra crops  We've been looking for about a year but haven't found anything close enough to our home farm yet 

Even if the land were available for free we would still have to upgrade all our equipment so we could work the extra acres and still hit all the deadlines for each crop  We would need 2 heavier tractors ($150000) a heavier seed drill ($30000) bigger cultivation equipment ($25000) etc 

You can't just switch from one type of farming to another without a major investment and most hog farmers are already maxed out  This is why many are forced to declare bankruptcy and sell out

at 4:59 PM ETThere are no shortcuts when it comes to agriculture  Keeping pigs in tight enclosures with nothing but metal grates under their feet feeding animals antibiotics until they build up resistance raising tens of thousands of animals at a time    The potential for greater profit margins through these activities is a myth  Eventually there's an outbreak and it's farmers who pay the price not the corporations who demand intensive factory farming 

It's not the farmers' fault though  The public demands cheap food and the government pumps money into unsustainable farming rather than other more secure agricultural pursuits  Corporations also put farmers into a position where they are hardly better off than indentured servants  Then when the you-know-what hits the fan farmers are on their own with hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt and no way to continue making even their regular meagre income to support their families or get out of the debt the farming industry put them in  Sometimes the government comes through with a small amount of cash to help alleviate the situation but it's never enough 

Protesting current farming practices is as much a human rights move as it is an animal rights one  We pay significantly more for fruits and vegetables yet we want hamburgers that cost $2  It will never work in the long term  Meat will never be cheap  It's just a matter of who's going to pay the price and when and you can bet the corporations aren't going to be the ones to lose their shirts when everything falls apart

at 5:07 PM ETNot very long ago all economists were speculating that China is booming and if Chinese make higher incomes they'll eat more meat our pork industry will be booming and the Canadians all geared up for that along with every other country in the world now there's oversupply   That's called the commodity game it's the same formula in every commoditized industry it always has been 

The solution to leveling out the commodity cycles as well as combatting COOL is in BRANDING  Create something slightly unique or even the perception of something possibly unique and brand it like the black angus beef people have done like the certified organic producers have done etc 

Canada has a very clean and natural positive perception all over the world  Branding something with a Canadian flag is powerful  The perception of the US is large scale operations with lots of drugs consumers all over the world including the US would likely choose a Canadian pork roast if that brand message was engrained in their head  That takes time and money to do and a committment from all involved 

And then there's niche specializations like organic or grass finished or free range etc  Maybe barley finished? Get creative nothing too much has to change maybe just what is said to change perceptions

I recently bought one half of a pig directly from the farmer and paid $1 25 per pound (delivered to my house)  I had to do my cutting but I knew what meet I got  Second the pig was butchered in the butcher house ($12 50 for killing the half of the pig - included in the price) with the inspection stamp  The pig was raised on the farmer's grain on the 160 acre farm  Third the guy is doing mixed farming with pig farming as the main and the only income  The guy make the living!!! but he sells the pigs direct to people  What a novel idea - just about ages new!!
I will never buy pork in the store again    the same for potatoes or vegetables (these I grow my own)  At least I know what I do with them before I cook them

at 7:31 PM ETIt's interesting to contrast the sort of picture the CBC uses when they have a story about the Canadian hog industry with the sort of picture they use when they have a story about the Canadian sealing industry  The picture above looks like a healthy live pig  Now take a look at the picture at the top of this story about the sealing industry 

http://www cbc ca/canada/newfoundland-labrador/story/2009/07/27/seal-hunt-ban-eu476 html

A stack of post slaughter bloody seal carcasses  If there's any sort of congruity to the way they are covering these things shouldn't the picture accompanying this story have been something like this:

http://sunsite berkeley edu/FindingAids/dynaweb/calher/jvac/figures/j11DB-158A jpg

I don't think they should be using pictures of dead bloody carcasses with either story  It tells you nothing about the how humane the animals death was and mostly serves to inflame the gullible and ignorant  This is of course very much in the interest of many animal rights extremist groups 

Maybe somebody from CBC could post a comment about why they seem to be sensitive to one industry but not the other? Are some Canadians more equal than others? How long before they don't show any sensitivity to any of Canada's animal husbandry industries?

I know that's not likely to happen but I just want to go on record that I recognize how the CBC blatantly ignores the mandate that it is funded with public money to fulfill  The CBC was the best hope that the Canadian sealers currently suffering the loss of their livelihood had  It completely failed them  It allowed itself to be used by the special interests mostly foreign that were demonizing these people and destroying their livelihood

at 8:19 PM ETI would like to add a bit of detail for the uninformed reader 

The US program called COOL(country of origin labeling) is a program intended to give more information to the US consumer about the food they eat (think 'product of canada' honey from China to get the idea)  On the surface it sounds like a perfectly reasonable program  But there are practical limitations at the packing plant  Specifically segregating the millions of pigs killed each week at US packing plants into Canadian and American is logistically impossible (so we are told)  So the US packers decided the simplest solution was to stop buying Canadian hogs Canadian being defined as either born or raised in Canada 

Of course this comes on the heels of a long period of Canadian production expansion erected to supply these same US packers  They liked our pigs because we had superior health genetics and when the dollar was low price  Since COOL came into effect all that capacity is no longer needed in Canada 

Unfortunately there is a lot of money owed to a lot of lenders against this production capacity (barns) and the only way to recover all that debt is to raise hogs in them  So the entire industry is in a catch 22 position 

Problem 2 is the fact that my brand spanking new $1000000 hog barn (a good starter facility) is virtually worthless on the market  But you still owe $975000?!

This is the position that 90% of the hog sector is in right now  There are no easy fixes to this mess  Whats more the US industry is eager to see our industry disappear 

What can you do? Ask your grocer for Canadian pork  Costco pork is US pork  Sobeys pork is sourced mostly out of Ontario

at 9:17 AM ETWell the government dropped the ball with the BSE and cattle industry  They knew that the feed was at issue and instead of banning it completely they bowed to the feed corporations and told them they could sell what they had but not produce any more of it 

So instead of stopping the issue and pushing the costs onto the producer of this poor quality feed they allowed this to proceed and the cost was pushed onto the farmer  What did the government do to help the beef farmer well of course give them $16 bucks a head wow how were they able to come up with that huge figure heck I can not even buy a bale of hay for that 

Rather then build more processing plants in Canada they regulate them to the point where the smaller plants are forced out of business  Rather then give them improvement loans and loans to increase production of meats Canada has seen it diminish 

So now we have to send our meat to the USA to be dealt with then shipped back up here to be sold boy is that good planning on part of our government  Can anyone say Support our big corporations at the expense of the smaller corporations?

Where is the long term plan here? Why do we need to import american meat into Canada? And that people support this idea by buying the meat is just plain stupid 

I for one refuse to buy it and when I see it in A&P I tell the meat manager that they should buy Canadian and support local beef producers and not americans else I will shop elsewhere 

If more people did this and actually refused to buy the american meat we would move production from going there to Canadians which I might add would be more green as well given the transportation cost savings

Yes animal husbandry operations tend to smell - however the solution to that problem is to utilize biogas technology  Biogas operations are often tacked on to hog dairy and beef operations in Europe  Basically all the runoff water manure urine and feed is place in a big tank with heat and microbes and stirred  Bingo - methane (CH4) then used to heat the buildings in which these animals live and provide energy to human living establishments as well - and carbon dioxide is produced (CO2) which can then be pumped into your greenhouse where your organic vegetables are grown in your freshly fertilized soil  Your fertilizer is the now processed manure which looks and smells like fresh soil but contains a much higher percentage of nutrients then regular varieties 

Many provinces provide assistance to farms that are looking for capital investment to create biogas operations 

Furthermorenitrites and nitrates are additives used to cure certain pork products  They aren't produced by pigs  Don't like additives? Go organic 

If you're such a proponent of healthy living perhaps being a little more informed about alternative farming methods would assist your cause 

Also it's a pity that some would feel indifference (pleasure? relief?) at the plight of an industry and the fact that those people are now without jobs and consequently will be relying on EI for financial support (i e  your tax dollars) 
I'd rather see my tax dollars go to improve the efficiency and environmental stewardship of animal husbandry operations as opposed to paying for their
welfare cheques

at 5:06 PM ETI feel obligated to provide a brief response to Ms  Webber 

With respect madam:

Why go to all the trouble of scrubbing pig waste and diverting it to big tanks to heat big pig houses when you could get rid of the waste problem for no money by just letting the industry lapse?

The land can be farmed for grain and corn and many other products that do not cause such horrendous waste problems as pig farms 

Society just does not need big industry hog farms  Sorry that's just the truth 

Its a tremendously inefficient use of gasoline fertilizer food antibiotics land air water etc 

And pig farmers don't have to be pig farmers - how insulting to their personal work ethics to suggest that they are now all going to be on EI  They will doubtless adapt and put their land to a different use

at 5:15 PM ETNot to seem uncaring about these farmers' and their situation- because I do feel for them- but where was the bailout when small time hog farmers such as my father were pushed out of business by the megabarns? It was a hard decision to make - mortgage our future to expand or get out  In the past 10 years or so it seemed as though everyone was jumping on the megabarn bandwagon and that flooded the market  If propping up small producers because they were not competitive was wrong then surely the same goes for these large operations who are likewise an unsustainable business

at 2:08 PM ETAs a motivational speaker for agriculture I given my presentation The Joy of Farming at dozens of farm producer meetings  Each time I speak I stress the importance of farm diversification in weathering weakness various commodity prices  Although the phrase the perfect storm has been overused in virtually every agriculture sector in the past decade if a person takes a long hard look at the big picture it becomes glaringly obvious that these boom and bust cycles are predictable 

Part of the reason that farmers are stuck in this avoidable rut is that governments at the both the provincial and federal level create agricultural programs that maintain the status quo  Every time that another producer group gets in financial trouble there are emergency loans or ad hock payments that give growers another reason to keep doing what they have always been doing regardless of the profitability of the individual operation 

Like every one industry town that owes its prosperity to a single mine or mill farmers that put all their eggs or in this case piglets into one basket will ultimately face the time of retribution when the perfect storm clouds form over their land holdings 

Instead of living in the problem it is time to live in the solution  For those looking for a solution have a peek at brunowiskel com

An Al Watan cartoon cited by the ADL had a caption saying: The World Health Organization is warning about a world-wide epidemic - the swine flu and showed Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu with a pig snout

This is a news report that Japan confirmed its first cases of swine flu Friday as Mexico raised its death toll from the outbreak to 45  Period!

From the tone of your comments you are most likely a member of an anti-China organization  If that is the case you have no credibility for whatever you say about China  Your accusation about China is purely out of your personal hatred toward to China that has nothing to do with the truth and reality in China today  The more you say the more shows how ridicules you are  You are making fool out yourself  Interesting enough there are quite a few like you in Canada  Canada has become a safe haven for political and financial criminals from other countries  Canada has become a center for social welfare collectors  Canadians have become more whiner than doers  Canadians often complain blame about other countries for their own false  Canadians just cannot get over with the idea that even China can do better than Canada  You better get over with it and get your life on track  China is going forward with open mind  China treats others with mutual respect without imposing attitude  Canada is trying to be an important player in the world arena but acting like protectionist and whining over nothing 

If you choose to stay in the bottom of the well and think the sky is just as small as the well opening you see from the bottom of the well then stay there forever  China has been moving forward on its right track where you poor guys will never catch and imagine

If this is a blog documenting an ongoing news item with daily updates then please make that clear  If it is a news article about a specific topic please ensure that the headline is broad enough to indicate what is covered in the article and write an internally consistent article

Did you want to eat this season or can you survive on bitterness and what i suspect would is an underlyig prejudice against Mexicans?

The door is open because people like to eat and Canadians like to think they should get paid $20/h for unskilled labour

http://en wikipedia org/wiki/Cytokine_storm

here is what wikipedia says about that:

It is believed that cytokine storms were responsible for many of the deaths during the 1918 influenza pandemic which killed a disproportionate number of young adults  In this case a healthy immune system may have been a liability rather than an asset  Preliminary research results from Hong Kong also indicated this as the probable reason for many deaths during the SARS epidemic in 2003 [citation needed] Human deaths from the bird flu H5N1 usually involve cytokine storms as well  Recent reports of high mortality among healthy young adults in the 2009 swine flu outbreak point to cytokine storms as being responsible for these deaths 

Hmmm   interesting

at 2:04 PM ETA couple of things to say here 

To those worried about Mexican Immigrant farm workers:

1) Go volunteer to do the jobs that they are coming here to do  The only way a foreign worker gets in is to do a job that employers can't find local workers willing to do 

2) You have a choice in this country right now because too many Canadians think that they are too good to pick produce and labor in farmers fields  You can accept foreign workers or you can accept that your tax money has to bail out farmers who can't make money this farm season because they can't find workers to help them in the fields  Of course the long term consequences of this is that our food production also goes way down and someone somewhere goes hungry too 

I don't like having to import foreign workers to do Canadian jobs while we are paying hundreds of millions of dollars a year to support Canadian workers on Employment Insurance and Welfare but we live in a country that will pay these benefits even while thousands of local jobs are sitting empty because again     Canadians are just too good for this kind of work!

Container of swine virus explodes on Swiss train
9 hours 33 mins ago - (Reporting by Sven Egenter (Reuters); Editing by Laura MacInnis)


A container of flu virus samples packed in dry ice exploded on a Swiss train injuring one person but posing no other risks to humans police said on Tuesday 
The box held vials of swine flu virus although a different strain than the H1N1 variety that has caused about 150 deaths in Mexico and infected people in the United States Canada Spain and Britain 
A technician was transporting the container on Monday night to the Swiss national flu centre in Geneva where scientists are developing a flu test for humans police said 
One woman was hurt when the box exploded in reaction to the dry ice used to keep the samples cold 
After consulting virus specialists the police decided to stop the St  Gallen to Geneva train before it entered the station in Lausanne 
The virus specialists confirmed that the samples being transported posed no risks to humans police said

Migrant workers are allowed to come into Canada because they will do the kind of work that not many Canadians are willing to do  Most Canadians would rather collect UI or Welfare than go work in a farmer's field picking produce  Canadians on UI or Welfare cannot be forced to do this kind of work and if they were forced would probably do a lousy job

at 2:26 PM ETOn the flu in general Canadians are just uninformed about the flu  Any old regular flu kills people every year in Canada that is why the government and health officials try so hard each year to get Canadians to be immunized against the flu 

Yes the Swine flu poses a threat just like any other contagious illness but media hype is currently blown out of proportion 

Having said that though you have to recognize that the threat is managed and balanced against other risks by PROFESSIONAL health care specialists 

The woman in a Mexican hospital that the ICU units in Ontario won't accept is really pretty straight forward  If the swine flu was introduced to an ICU it could kill the majority of patients in there because of their weakened state  On the other hand the woman is being treated in a Mexican hospital where on many measures the level of treatment that she is likely receiving is better than what she will get here (I have had a critically ill family member treated in Mexico and can say that the overall care that he received in a private medical hospital paid for by travel insurance was superior to the treatment that he received here in Canada when we managed to get him home) 

Everything is a BALANCE of risks vs benefits  We let Canadians return from Mexican vacations because the risk is less than the hardship and problems that would be caused by blocking them  We allow Canadians to still go on their Mexican vacations because the inconvenience and financial loss to thousands of Canadians would be worse than the minimal risk of importing a few cases of flu 

Get used to it  Life is about balancing risk  If you think you can do it better apply for the job and see how you compare against the experts who have the difficult job of making these decisions

at 2:28 PM ETdo you guys really not understand why tracking this is important? Once the virus is communal in that people who haven't been to Mexico have it in your area then you will begin to see more and more cases 

They may have mild cases  That doesn't mean everyone will  The target age range that tends to get run over by this virus is 25-50  Most of the people being reported to have it are outside that age range in Canada and the US  In those areas where there are mild cases there are also a few suspected cases of death IN THE HEALTHY ADULT population (see two deaths in LA )

That's the problem 

No one on Earth has any immunity to this flu  Unlike any other flu you've ever had  It doesn't just kill the weak - it kills the healthy and strong by drowning you in your own mucus and suffocating you with damage to your lungs in the robustly healthy adult by making your fabulous immune system attack your lungs 

The mild cases mean that the people probably couldn't get out of bed for a week  That's the MILD version 

Are you starting to get why this IS NOT the common flu that you had two winters ago?

This virus may just peter out  It may become less lethal over sussessive mutations  Entirely possible  Likely even 

It also might do what the Spanish Flu did and flat line for the summer with a small kill rate and then mutate into a worse form that kills millions of people over the winter  Millions of healthy working age Mommy-and-Daddy-aged people  That is a major impact to your economy if all the other reasons but your cheque book don't take root in your head 

Don't panic  Also don't be so stupid that you see the train coming at you and think - ah whatever I see trains every day!

at 2:29 PM ETlovealberta …  “Mexican Workers & Immigration  Why are they allowed to come to Canada?”

That’s an easy one

at 4:20 PM ETModern-day antibiotics will NEVER EVER EVER stop a pandemic VIRUS as antibiotics are not effective against viruses they are only usefull to combat BACTERIAL INFECTIONS 
Swine flu is a virus not a bacterial infection 
This is why there is now widespread antibiotic resistant organisms  People go to the doctor and get antibiotics prescribed for viral infections (commonly cephalexin ciprofloxacin levofloxacin)  So you take these antibiotics which do NOTHING to the virus that is in your system  However now you have diminished your body's natural immunity to actual bacterial infections and it's ability to fight off both viral AND bacterial infections in the future 
Antibiotics are great    but only for bacterial infections which are suseptible to the antibiotic that is prescribed to you  For example: if you get a bacterial strep infection of the throat the bacteria is only suseptible to selective antibiotics as it has a resistance to many others  People in the community need to be more informed and educated about the difference between viruses and bacterial infections and look into what your doctor is prescribing  Doctors are just people too  Some are good and some are very bad  Some will even prescribe you and antibiotic for a virus because they don't have the time to properly investigate and find out if your symptoms are caused by a bacterial or a viral infection  It is a lot easier to give someone a lillte piece of paper and tell them to go to their pharmacy than it is to take a sputum sample or throat swab and send it of to a laboratory for testing before they decide what to prescribe to you

Every senior who feels similarly dissed by this administration's cold calculating attitudes towards their future well-being should remember it come November 2 2010  Although not retired and not on Medicare I'm still considered a senior and I will make sure that my vote truly expresses how I feel  At some point we voters have to toss the garbage out or just keep quiet and be content to live with the maggots and the stench until we die  Life is all about making choices  The time to send the message to this arrogant and thug-like administration is now! Call or write your Representatives and Senators and tell them exactly how you feel  Get involved  Make your voices heard 
membrane (11 months ago)     

One CNSNews com reader suggested the omission is in line with the Obama’s administration’s plan to minimize health care for the elderly  This is just ridiculous fearmongering without regard to facts  If you've been following the news about swine flu the elderly are much less susceptible: http://tinyurl com/mqgsk5 Around the world health authorities have been stunned as they have witnessed what is more or less an inversion of the normal age distribution for influenza infections     [A] solid majority of them have been detected in young people while the elderly seem to be largely spared  For normal flu seniors are prioritized  For swine flu they are not affected very much - but pregnant women are so they're being prioritized as well as the usual classes such as health workers

cappicola (11 months ago)     

Seniors have been told for decades to make sure they get their flu shot every fall i e  October  With the H1N1 strain preoccupying the media and this administration's health agencies I can easily understand that seniors feel they're being left in a lurch  If not an H1N1 vaccination then what influenza vaccination should seniors be focused on getting this year - they vary from year to year - AND will that vaccine be readily available to them come October? Can a person get two vaccines? Should they? It's a widely-accepted fact that like Murphy's Law if bureaucrats are given the opportunity to drop the ball they often oblige  The only question is how badly will folks be affected? The brand new Cash for Clunkers Program although apparently very well received by Americans like the realities of the economic crisis and unemployment was severely underestimated by the braintrust in D C  and is just a safe bet as to what can and may go wrong with H1N1 distribution 
liberty76 (11 months ago)

DrKete (11 months ago)     

Good news for once! Not having a flu vaccination is a good thing  This 'swine-flu' scare is blown way out of proportion  And treating it with Tamiflu is even worse! Do some research about how little help this vaccine does and how much harm and draw your own conclusions  Give people a choice I am more worried that these cretins will require us to take this poison  Andif you are pregnant and get ANY vaccine you are risking the health of your baby  Big risk for little benefit

As far back as I can remember Democrats have used their usual scare tactic on seniors during presidential electionsIf you vote Republican they will take away your social security  They want to give the impression that the Dems will look out for the elderly  With this H1N1 vacine issue and the debate over national healthcare it is quite obvious the Dems have been taking the elderly to be a bunch of idiots  Senior citizens have no standing as far as the current administration is concerned  I suggest that all seniors get involved to oust the current Democratic regime and to drop AARP as a clear signal that our lives will not be toyed with

Chatty Kathy (10 months ago)     

So you're all epidemiologists here? NO? Infectious disease experts? Didn't think so  There is no way to adequately produce enough vaccine for every single person so the aim is to target vectors(those who would spread the disease) and those who would be most affected by contracting it how the disease moves within the population  Current research shows that the rate of infection among those over 65 is less than 1 percent  This may indicate that that portion of the population has some immunity left over from prior swine flu outbreaks  Maybe you all should learn something about a subject before forming an OPINION?

Believe me death from influenza is not dying with dignity as they so nicely put their brand of their version of the 'final solution' for the elderly  It nice to know that according to govt figures (which I am sure we can trust) less than 1% of seniors will get the flu and the prognosis for the elderly who get it is what? How many elderly do you know without some underlying medical condition? Plus I am sure that we have a lot of senior citizen who got their immunity in the last great outbreak in 1918  Why have senior always been a priority for immunization in every other flu out break but just not this one

This federal rationing and prioritizing of health care is exactly what Sarah Palin meant by the risk of being denied health care by a death panel  Obama Been Lyin' when he said that he has no intent to pull the plug on Grandma since the death or mortal illness of Grandma is exactly what may happen should doctors be prevented from providing the hopefully potent swine flu vaccination to her  If Grandma is not in the priority list who is responsible for her possible life or death? I suggest that we all are responsible if we give the authority to the bureaucracy rather than to her doctor her family and herself  A rationing of health care should only be the result of private provider to patient health care decisions but not on the decisions of socialistic death panels or murder boards  Just consider the following groups who have no priority in the federal group allocations: Orphans Husbands of Pregnant Women National Leaders and Other Social Workers and Emergency  Workers

I've already made my appointment  I'm taking every precaution I can to avoid getting this flu or worse passing it on to others  Anyone who doesn't get the vaccine is selfish and socially irresponsible

Passing it on to a child is wrong but endangering yourself with this untested unstable shot is a big risk  Have you researched where this flu shot is spawned from? I think that people could see things get much worse with this shot (tamiflu) and make things much worse

The main reason that Dr  Butler-Jones is having trouble convincing the public to get the shot is due to the fact that a non-proven product is being forced on us by the government who traditionally have no idea what they are doing and that the Pandemic in most peoples mind is totally fabricated  It seems stange that if this disease is so wide spread and that hardly no one knows anybody who has had the H1N1 virus? But they say how dire the situation is so we must get the shot since we have spent hundreds of millions of dollars on it

I have one question only for the Government Is this GUARANTEED protection for anyone receiving the shot or passing it along? Due to MY past reactions from the FLU SHOTS (within 36 hours of receiving the needle) this puts ME at risk for this Vaccine  I do not want anyone to get sick BUT the risk is to great for me - also the push to get it onto the market UNTESTED is another factor  Still pondering who is at risk!!!!

I think the worry for me as a pregnant woman is that they only have the adjuvanted flu vaccine so its not like the regular flu vaccine and there is no real data on the use of adjuvanted flu vaccine in pregnant women or young children  So now I may have to wait a month? Very concerning

Conflicting info?- The mean age of infection is 18  Then it was 40  Then it was back to 18 - Can't get regular flu shot and the H1N1  Then you can  The fact is flu shots' effects are limited to about 3 months  No way last yrs flu shot is going to effect ANYTHING in your immune system this yr - There is no 'seasonal' flu this year so no need for any vaccine other than swine  No there is a seasonal vaccine The truth is they DON'T know the long term effect of the adjuvant as it has only been used in seniors who have maybe 10 yrs left  If a 20 yr old gets adjuvant what is the effect in 20-40 or more years? Worse yet the effect in children  Seniors' metabolism is not the same as a 16 yr old

No Thank you     When you have Health and Gov't officials that DO NOT know what they are doing to keep the population safe it's better to listen to rumours rather than the unknown Perhaps its starts with better education and better information from the top which is the Officials!!!! Changing their minds daily can mislead the already uncertains

I will not be getting the vaccine  In my opinion you do not need to be a doctor to know it is not right to inject mercury formaldehyde and who knows what other chemicals into your body  I used to get the regular flu shot every year and I also used to get the flu every year  I stopped getting that vaccine 5 years ago and have been flu free ever since

According to the latest government stats I've seen 83 people have died in the entire country and the majority of those had contributing health problems  When you look at how many people die every year from the Regular Flu heart disease cancer and other major killers this H1N1 thing is getting blown way out of proportion      I can't help but think that a very small number of people are going to make an awful lot of money mostly based on fear mongering      No I'm not getting the flu shot!

In the Fredericton area of NB pregnant women clinics are well after the other clinics my elementary aged child and my least at risk (for the under 65 group) husband will have their vaccines long before I will On one hand they discourage people gathering in large group but our only option to have our elementary aged children vaccinated is to attend one of 4 clinics which is supposed to accomodate all elementary school children in the city children 6 mos-5 years and people 65 & under with pre existing conditions for the entire city  Even with additional clinics for the remainder of the general public next week it doesn't exactly discourage going out in a highly populated area  Ridiculous  Meanwhile other areas of NB have managed to set up clinics during school hours for elementary aged children reducing public contact

Based on the comments about 50% of the readers here have fallen victim to the media propaganda around this flu virus and vaccination 

As with our most common influenza virus - the main reason to get a flu shot is money 

You body DOES have the ability to fight of these viruses by proper health food and care  Building your own immune system is the answer not falling victim to this bogus cash grab 

Scared to spread it if you get it? Simply follow very basic hygiene and wash your hands cover your mouth etc   be respectful of your co-workers and stay home 

This is total BS

For those who keep asking why 50 million doses were ordered when there's only 34 million Canadians it's because for a while experts thought we would need 2 doses of the vaccine whereas recent research has shown that one dose of vaccine with adjuvant is enough for adults  Children between 6 months and 12 years still need two doses  And the government didn't know so many people would be reluctant to get it  If everyone would then the 50 million doses would be just right  Voila! Im an elementary school teacher in contact with little kids including one immuno-suppressed child and yes I am definitely getting this vaccine  It's too bad so many of you are so paranoid  Life must be a sad place when everyone's out to get you!

Reading these post makes me glad we live in a country that allows us to choose  Though I must say the level of whiningthe accusations of some giant conspiracythe snivelling about who who will get the shot and who will notand the fear that someone who makes the vaccine will actually make a profitare insane It's your body and your life As it should begetting the shot or not getting the shot is your choice I would just urge people to make their choice FOR THE RIGHT REASONSAND NOT BECAUSE OF SOME HYSTERIA FOR EITHER SIDE OF THE DEBATE 

And finallyif you make the personal choice not to have the vaccineacceptwith gracethe responsibility that comes with your right to decline the vaccination IF YOUR ARE UNFORTUNATE ENOUGH TO GET SICKSTAY HOME NO ONE HAS THE RIGHT TO INFECT SOMEONE ELSE THROUGH CARELESSNESS OR IGNORANCE Andif you have a friend or neighbour who gets sickstep up and offer to make a trip to the storeor run an errand or two if they need something done That will help them avoid passing it on  This is not likely the end of the world But it is time for two rare commoditiesCOMMON SENSE and RESPECT for other people  ME?? I've had the shots every year since I started my job at BC Transit 10 years ago Not only have I survived the shotsI almost never get the flu any more Whereas beforeI got it once or twice EVERY YEAR  Neither choice is totally wrong Passing this virus on to others is wrong That poor little girl got the flu from someoneand she did not deserve to die

I am shocked at the number of people commenting here who are refusing to get vaccinated  All I read are conspiracy theories about drug companies and big brother  Guess what folks - the vaccines have already been purchased! Not getting a shot won't save taxpayers one penny  All that will happen is that: a) the government will spend more tax dollars on ad campaigns because people aren't getting vaccinated in sufficient numbers  b) there will be an increased load on the medical system when more people get sick with the flu than need toc) you will put your friends family and co-workers at greater risk of contracting the fluAll of this because you're afraid of a tiny poke in the arm? Or because you have some misguided anti-corporate / anti-government conspiracy theories?I really cannot understand this attitude  I suppose the one small blessing is that people like you will result in shorter lineups for people like me and my family

Number of people who died in the US last year from the seasonal flu: 36000  Number that died from getting the flu shot: ZERO CHRIS: Where are you getting your data from? Zero died from a vaccine? How about the last round of swine flu? The vaccine killed more than the flu? The vaccine placed 6000 people into mental wards for life  They suffer from mental psychosis and will NEVER recover  How about in Japan today - they are reporting severe reactions to the vaccine with many in semi-consicous states  What about the stats that state fatalities? Maybe you choose to believe what you want? In 2005 they predicted 150 million people will be dead because of the Avian flu! What was up with that? Now they are giving us a code red type alerts - I think the Bush administration blunted that tactic as nobody pays attention anymore with boys who call wolf too often

I think the biggest problem with mass vaccination programs is believing that we are all the same  Genetically we are subject to different illnesses  Could boosting or tampering with an immune system be responsible for the dramatic increase in allergies asthma and autoimmune illnesses? If you do develop an autoimmune illness even if it is years later you can bet it will be deemed a coincidence

Wilfully refusing to protect your family friends and community by not taking the flu vaccine is an immoral act  In 1918-1919 millions died from a rare strain of flu many in remote places where it would seem unlikely to appear  Choosing to put others at risk - perhaps at risk of losing there life - on grounds that amount to little more than arrogance is a shameful burden of guilt your family friends and you may not have the opportunity to live with

No one should be forced into it but in our case where i work they pretty much are and its not to bad of an idea considering people have died from this underlying health conditions or not people have died thats what im thinking about  The people who have no consideration to wash their hands and make sure they are not spreading the germs around are the people who are going to get sick and guess what no sympathy for me  Everyone needs to start acting like adults here wash your hands cough into your arm as well as sneeze into your arms    stop the spread of germs and stop acting like infants  your supposed to be responsible   im getting the h1n1 flu shot

With all due respect to the honorable opposition leader the federal government DOES NOT DELIVER healthcare  They can articulate strategies and priorities but ultimately it is the PROVINCES responsibility to deliver and execute The challenges of delivering this vaccine are not limited to Canada shortages at ground level and production issues are being reported in the US and Britain It would appear that Liberals are attempting to make political hay during this time of confusion and uncertainty and for that they should be ashamed  I hope voters remember this whenever the next election is held

Does anyone else think it would have been simpler to get children immunized if they'd have put the vaccine in the schools first  Then instead of dragging the kids out of schools to stand in a humungous lineup with their parents they could have been organized by class to go in an orderly fashion to get their shot from the public health nurse that I assume is still on staff at most schools  It's all done in a couple of days and theres no need for this annoying public outcry because of the lack of organization  It doesn't take a genious to see that two or three million shots isn't going to get everyone immunized in the first day or two  Relax the most likely place to come in contact with the flu is at the clinic  I'm staying as far away as I can

I certainly can see the priority for pregnant women small kids and health care workers  BTW how do you assess whether a lady is pregnant if she isn't showing??What I don't see is First Nations at the forefront they always say they want to be treated just like all other Canadians well treat them like the rest of Canadians in this circumstance  OR do they want equal treatment only at their convenience?

I'm normally critical of the Conservative government but I fail to see how the drug shortage is their fault  Yes they could have offered better guidelines to municipal health authorities but there's no reason to blame the drug shortfall on GSK I think that Minister Aglukkaq is doing a great job on the H1N1 front especially with how rapid it has evolved since the summer

Why should we all wait hours in line to get our flu shots?Why can't we just go to the nearest clinic or family physician to get it done?Why don't they just roll out the vaccines in schools so that way the kids at least are not taking time out from school to wait in line  The same approach could be used at highschools I just don't understand this govt approach in rolling out the vaccine It seems to be taking longer which is why people are so frusterated

It is deplorable that the Liberals are so desperate to make voters think they are an effective opposition that they are using scare tactics inuendo and vague accusations of how the government has somehow failed I am not a huge supporter of the government however in this case I think the opposition has no business using peoples' fears to try and gain some political advantage  Shame on them As a person who falls into the 'under 65 with a cronic medical condition' catagory I went to a local clinic last night in hopes of getting a vaccination  My wife and I were in and out in 20 minutes Trying to help would seem a more appropriate response from the Opposition Benches  Again shame on you

If this flu is so dangerous Why does the current maker of this vaccine not hire other companies to help with the production of this shot that everyone needs so despirtly  Yearly we have flu's that take lives  Because this is taking a different group we should ALL be concerned? Please take a step back do what we do every year let that group who needs this shot get it and the earth will rotate in the same direction as yesturday

Maybe iggy should go home and lobby the democrats to hire at least another five companies that would make the ratio equal to Canada's [ten to one]

I think all governments (Federal and Provincial) are doing an okay job  They could have held off doing any shots until February 2010 and then had enough to go around but instead decided to roll out the vacine as it became available  That is prudent  This stuff cannot be made with the twitch of a nose  It is frsutrating but it takes time

If they didn't know they are incompetent for not finding out sooner if they did know they're just liars

These are sick comments coming from IGGY first it was Bob Rae blaming the PC Party for shortages of vaccines and causing the deaths of several persons and now IGGY using those deaths to try to gain points in the polls  It's not going to work  You are trying to capitalize on the backs of people who died  Pretty sick if you ask me  Try telling the people who are NOT in the priority group to stay put until they are advised  The news media doesnt help either by telling everone to get their injections A S A P  which only cause long linups for nothing

There will always be learning experiences coming up and how to deal with a flu pandemic is exactly that  The Canadian government I believe has done a good job  The vaccine was made and purchased in good time  the information on how to prevent getting the flu has been clearly given to people and now it is up to the provinces to get it distributed  Regarding the shortages that is not the governments fault it is the drug companies

Regardless of political stripe I only wish more Canadians were aware that health care delivery is the domain of the provinces not the federal government  They have a guiding role but cannot enforce anything regarding delivery  Nor can they pull an extra million doses out of their behinds  This mess as some call it is a bottom-up and sideways one with the provincial health systems faulting (mostly in a purely understandable structural way) and the drug company faulting (in an unsurprising way)  But since many of us are clearly too foolish to actually assign the correct responsibility don't expect this to change the next time out  Again simply stated the federal government cannot enforce H1N1 flu protocol as they have no jurisdiction  They set minimum guidelines at best

Man you guys are pretty thick  The reason why this rollout is being categorized as 'bungled' is because not enough funds were dedicated to having enough frontline staff to administer the shot and not having a consistent 'priority' list across the country (which is why in Alberta we faced a shortage so early)  One of the consequences of diverting funds from hiring front line workers to paying for Conservative partisan advertising on the Economic Action Plan website is that you create HUGE lineups which feeds the fears that supplies will runout which creates even more demand Great choice in Ministers Steve - amateur hour 7 days a week

My 2 young children were immunized yesterday but my pregnant wife (2 mths) was not allowed to receive the shot due to the adjuvent What about all the other pregnant women that have already been inoculated with this vaccine?How is it that there are soooo many different opinions coming from the medical professionals?That is seriously worrisome!I on the other hand a healthy 35 year old DID NOT take the shot so that someone considered high-risk say a little kid would have that opportunity! If it's true that we will/do have a shortage there is no way I could morally take the shot away from someone that needs it more!

This has been poorly administered since the get-go  I don't believe it when the Health Minister says this is from years of preparation  In Ottawa the way the vaccine is administered is all over the map  They have been giving it to anyone and then once in a while they reject some people no wonder there is confusion  At the same time people of Ottawa and everywhere else listen to the message here stop lining up and being selfish if you're not part of any priority group and let those that need it get their shot  The way things are being done is so ridiculous  The governments and individuals are all to blame

The conservatives can't take the high road on this one  The opposition are correct in calling out Harper on his management of the H1N1 crisis  Lack of planning poor communication creating a state of anxiety etc  have all lead to a deplorable situation with people standing in bad weather for hours and then getting turned away because there is not enough vaccine  Its a sham  Why doesn't the government have more than one supplier  Why didn't they communicate better with public on the distribution of the vaccine  They spent double or more the amount of money on advertising their stimulus package but when it came to the health of Canadians they didn't seem to care  I guess it would be difficult for a conservative MP to be holding up a cardboard cheque with his name on it beside an H1N1 clinic  All of you folks saying that Harper and his minister Leona have been doing a good job with this file better go back to management basics  Among Harper's other screw-ups this one ranks up near the top

I agree with Pugfire why should First Nations not be like everyone else their pregnant women should be immunized first but everyone else suck it up and deal with it like every other Canadian  The kids in schools should have had it first since thats where and when they have been predicting all along that it would ramp up    My kids and I both have it now its too late for the shot and my son had a heart transplant how is that fair?? Most of the kids are out of school already  Are First Nations and prisoners more important than my children and I???? Its a huge mess  They knew it was coming they should have gotten their thumbs out of their butts and done something sooner

Perhaps Mr  Ignatieff's diatribe of blame-laying should be aimed at the provincial ministers of health after all they are the ones responsible for ensuring the vaccine is distributed fairly and properly  Besides that I have no doubt that Mr  Ignatieff would be equally indignant if the manufacturer had produced all adjuvanted vaccine first and then switched to the unadjuvanted form - or vice versa  It seems to me that all he can do is seize any opportunity to make himself heard criticising the government for the flimsiest of reasons  Suggestion to the Liberal Party: call a convention and decide on a platform that you can sell to Canadians instead of just mouthing off with criticisms and wait-and-see platitudes  And while you are at it how about ELECTING a leader? Coronations should be left to royalty who don't have any say in the running of a nation they certainly have no place in a supposedly democratic party

If the clinics are targeting high risk populations perhaps those people should be fast-tracked for vaccinations  Plenty of pregnant women and people with chronic diseases find it extremely difficult to wait in line-ups for hours 

Lisa
I don't think I will get the shot  They pushed this shot to be approved without it being tested so what if those who DO get the shot and then they find out it was NOT safe   then what?

Michelle
I am 8 months pregnant with 2 children under the age of 6  I heard there is a 3 hour wait time  Do they think it will ease up throughout the week? I know I can't keep my kids entertained that long 

Nicki - Sherwood Park
Glad we can get some protection from this virus but with two kids under four and a two to three hour wait I left the health centre disheartened  We'll try again tomorrow but I wonder how many people won't bother?

I arrived at Westmount at 8:30 and was gone by 11:00  I don't consider that too bad considering the footage I saw on CNN yesterday  My biggest complaint was the paperwork  There was an awful lot of paperwork  My family of five could have been done once on a computer  Instead we had to fill out ten forms (5 for H1N1 and 5 for seasonal flu) manually  That part was frustrating but the staff was very good and overall co-ordination seemed pretty good too  Another weird observation is that most of the nurses seemingly arrived at 10:00 a m  (to a cheer from the crowd) and not at 9:00 a m  

Peggy
As an RN I have seen patients with H1N1  Before you decide not to get the flu shot (either one) ask yourself Can I afford to take at least a week of work? Be prepared to feel very ill and understand the need to be quarantined when you are ill  You will be contagious from 24 hours before you feel it and then for 7 days  The cough will last for about a month after  Remember to those of you who are young mothers    over 60 per cent of the deaths have been young women 
I will be first in line to get mine!

CathyC
I am 35 weeks pregnant and have two children ages 4 and 1  I waited in line in Red Deer for over 4 hours this morning even through I arrived at the exact time the clinic was opening  I'm now scared that we picked up the flu or something just waiting in line with all those hundreds of people  Public health should have had a separate clinic for those in the high risk category  One man in the line was clearly ill and was asked to leave by a public health nurse and he refused!

nurse Di
Well I just stood in line with my family for 45 minutes when a security guard for the mall @ 4:45pm in Bonnie Doon came and told us to go home as the line was too long and that there was a 3 5 hour wait from a certain point to the front and the clinic is done at 8 p m  tonight  I'm disgusted! Alberta Health Services couldn't even organize enough nurses to accommodate the masses of people who are trying to get the vaccine to prevent a pandemic hopefully  I'm a nurse and many nurses I know would have been willing to work to get this done  This is very poor 

Tim
We tried St  Paul Bonnyville & Cold Lake    all of them had no H1N1 flu shots just seasonal 

Rita
I work in health care and cannot get the H1N1 vaccination until Nov 3rd  I was also told that it takes two weeks before it is effective  There should be clinics set up at hospitals for front line workers and more clinics for the public as there are long waits  We keep hearing from health officials that it is important to get the shot but it is not easily accessible!

K P  3rd Year Nursing Student
I get so frustrated hearing about the line ups and the issue behind staffing the flu clinics  I am a 3rd year nursing student and I'm angered that the idea of having us help with the staffing shortage has not even been mentioned! We learn how to do injections in our second year and normally half of the class will do annual flu shots once they have learned but this year with the annual flu shot being available to all and with the H1N1 shot as well I would think that they would approach us to help do the shots  Three years of students of about 100-150 students at the U of A are available to help do the shots that's around 400 extra help they could utilize plus the MacEwan students but they haven't even entertained the idea of having us help! I guess we're just going to have to bare those lengthy lines!

skeptic
This seems like Y2K all over again  A lot of hype over nothing 

Heather
We live in Red Deer and we had one clinic today and our next one is not until Thurs  Problem with Thurs  is that it is only 9-5  Line-ups are so long and people are waiting outside to get to the reception table to get a number to start the wait time  Alberta Health has not thought this one out at all! We need more access to the vaccine and Alberta Health wont even release it to the pharmacy or the doctors  We have enough we have people who will go for it  Oh wait with absentees in the schools already we will all have had it within the next 4 weeks and we won't need to go to a clinic  Get with it Alberta Health! We need more clinics and we need them now!!!

Melissa
Are you kidding I won't ever get this shot! I was never planning on getting it but now they don't even know if its safe for pregnant woman they don't sound so confident  What will they blame it on when someone miscarries from this shot  A pre existing condition

Not worth my life or my daughter's!

TJ McDonnell
Yea I think I just have the regular flu right at the moment  Should I still get the shot?

Shirley Campbell-Pease
My husband and I are 81 and 73 years of age  We waited along with hundreds of others at Westmount Community Health Centre for the H1N1 vaccine  It was a pleasant day and the people around us were friendly and talkative  We were prepared to wait as long as necessary for our shots and estimated by the crowd ahead of us that the wait may be up to two hours 

However our wait was only about 3/4 of an hour] as a security man came along and saw that my husband was using a walker  He ushered us into a special room on the ground floor where the nurses were vaccinating older people special needs people and young children 

We were very pleased with the care and concern that was shown to us and everyone around us  This is a big city and we all can't be first in line!

Chase
People are worrying too much about the H1N1 pandemic and the media are the ones to blame  This outbreak is no different than any other pandemics like bird flu and SARS that the world has been through  We will get through this like we have many times before 

PHYLLIS Bright
I will NOT be getting the H1N1  I am very allergic to fish and the vaccine contains squalene - a derivative from shark oil  Alberta Health Services told me that I could get it - however I should do it in a controlled environment with my EpiPen handyand make sure that the person giving me the shot knew about my allergy but that I would probably be OK  It just isn't worth it 

Jane
I appreciate that our health care system is strapped for workers but why not get some of the nurses that are in their last year of school or ask retired nurses to come to work for a few hours a day to help out  It would be a win win situation for everybody 

Lisa
I will not be getting this vaccination if health officials don't know the side effects of receiving this injection then why should I be rolling up my sleeve? There has been no results from clinical studiesdone here in Canada and this appears to be a rush job plus a lot of contradiction about this injection  I do get my flu shot annually every year and received it last week  Health Canada you need to get your act together 

bill from edmonton
I am in one of the target groups with a Cardiac history but no way will I stand in line for 4 hours! The Government should allow the at risk Albertans to get their shots first and then followed up with shots for the healthier Albertans  Once again the Government couldn't organize a simple task but made it into a joke for the rest of Canada to laugh at !! Sad sad sad 

Kelly
I am a teacher and a mother of a Spina Bifida child in Whitecourt  Went to the hospital twice today and would take up to two hours for the shot  I thought or was under the impression that high risk was to be targeted first  How is the province make sure this is happening 

Rebecca Dibbelt
My son is a 14-year-old immuno-compromised cancer patient undergoing chemo treatments and my asthmatic 7-year-old daughter are certainly high risk  Yet when we went to the health unit for H1N1 (as well as the seasonal flu) shots we were told to go home as they had all the people they could take that day  When I explained our situation we were told that all patients are a priority and get in line  We were advised to try again tomorrow or maybe the day after that or if that didn't work maybe the next day 

Something seriously wrong with Alberta Health's management on this one 

I am disgusted 

philip
My pregnant wife (7 months) and 20 month old daughter went to the south side clinic in Edmonton Rutherford an hour before closing  We were turned away  What happened to the public announcement of pregnant women and young children to get priority especially in a long line up  The doorman or usher should have been made aware of these situations and quickly ushered us in to get the shots  Why is this message not passed on to people working at these clinics regarding priority patients? Not very well planned out  Surely they do not expect pregnant women with small children to be waiting and standing for over an hour   Where is the common sense and compassion in all of this?

Dan
Why are we not able to get this shot from our family doctor????

We are not physically able to stand in a line up for three hours 

I have never before seen such an asinine fouled up arrangement  The people responsible should be given enforced one way tickets to Siberia or some other suitable destination 

Joy
There are no provisions for people with chronic health conditions or people with a disability  I am high risk and am in a wheelchair  I can not wait outside for hours  It is essential that I get the H1N1 

Where can people with disabilities get the flu shot to avoid the lengthy wait? I called my doctor but she can't get the immunization shot for me 

Gary
In the last 7 days according to Wikipedia there has been an increase in deaths in Canada and around the world 

I am skeptical myself but I really do wonder for those who are angry about the hype what they will do if they catch it 

It's a lot of hype but the hype is there for a reason 



Leanne
I am disappointed by conflicting advice from professionals  The Society of Ob/Gyn Canada is urging women more than 20 weeks pregnant to get immunized immediately with or without the adjuvant vaccine while the government is telling all pregnant women to wait until the non-adjuvant vaccine is available 

I am a pregnant woman in my 3rd trimester with 3 children under the age of 4 home  Our family of 5 waited 3 hours to get immunized today I only hope that I have made the right decision 

Parents of young children may be surprised to know that a second dose is required in 3 weeks--I sure hope more immunization clinics will be scheduled for that time frame--waiting in line with babies and preschoolers is very challenging 

kewpiemd
It's not all hype    I got H1N1 (in July) and so did my 1 month old premature baby who had to be hospitalized  Thank GOD she made it through alright  To the pregnant women who rather not get this shot    you're really risking your life (and your baby's)    by NOT getting the vaccine  Pregnant women are at very high risk of becoming seriously ill and even dying with this flu 

Rowena
My husband and my 3 year old daughter tried to line up first thing in the morning and was told there's a 3 hour wait  They both went home not getting one because it's just too long of a wait  I went back in the afternoon with my daughter again and my 5 year old son  The line up is just as long  I am also 15 weeks pregnant with our 3rd  We all went home not getting the shot  I just wish there is a separate line-up for the so-called high risks (children and pregnant women)and should be given the first priority 

Shana
This is nuts  Did people really expect on the FIRST day the shot was available that they would be in and out in 10 minutes? Of course there is going to be a line hundreds of people long  Don't complain that you don't want to wait  If you don't want to wait    try again next week when the majority of people receiving the shot will have already had it  People need to stop complaining about lack of staff etc  when the real issue is the patience level of the individual  However elderly and pregnant women shouldn't have to face the discomfort of waiting  Young able bodied people should try later when they won't have to wait as long 

Sheri
As someone who has had this horrible flu and then watched my children suffer with this for two weeks  I don't think people can just sit back and wonder what could be the potential side effects to this vaccine  I was hospitalized with this in August  I ended up developing pneumonia and being placed on oxygen  This truly is a disease not to be reckoned with 

Devon
I plan to wait 3 months before getting the shot lets get past the hype first then worry about it 

Irene
Jody's comment about targeting high risk populations was right on the mark  I am personally suffering from 2 cancers and thus have a low immune system  It is difficult for me to wait in line for hours 

Pharmacist in Edmonton
To skeptic
Just wanted to let you know that I am working in a pharmacy and the number of sick people consistent with H1N1 infection is way increased and although still mostly mild lots of people still can't go back to work for at least a week  Also I have to stay home now as I am sure I am getting it (I was yet to be immunized for the H1N1 only but the line up was too long yesterday) and I could only wish this vaccine came sooner  This threat is real and maybe more dangerous than people think 

Donna
Maybe the politicians need to wait in these lineups and not get any special treatment  Fat chance that is going to happen!! What poor planning!!!

Diane Romanchuk
Re immunization clinics would it be possible for Alberta Health to put the form on-line similar airline boarding passes  People could complete the form at home print it off and bring it with them to the immunization clinic 

Paul D 
why can't the health officials expand more flu shot clinics across the whole province?",,,,,,,$$$

I tried to get a shot at Westmount  I can not physically stand up for what appears to be a multiple hour wait so I left  How can anyone think the Westmount location can meet the demands of hundreds of thousands of people in central and west Edmonton? Until they figure out how to administer these shots with proper efficiency they should stop pushing people to get the shots  Great system--scare many people and be the only supplier of the shots 

John
I live near Tofield Alta  and tonight I was turned away from getting the vaccine at the Tofield Community Hall  They said they were closing at 7 p m  sharp and didn't have time to fit me or anyone else in even though they had lots of vaccine   I was to go to Edmonton or Camrose  This was at 6:15 p m  I was told the nurses had started at 1:00 p m  and were getting tired  If they are getting tired why don't they take a break and then continue working? That is what I do at work but I guess six hours of work is too much for them  I thought nurses worked 12 hour shifts at least they could work a full eight like everyone else 


Diane
If this is the best they can do rolling out a mass vaccination program I shudder to think what we'd do if this was a truly deadly pandemic!!

Too Tired
Drayton Valley vaccine clinic is a joke  Why did they have to have it where most people have to stand outside and get damp and cold? If I wait in that I will die of pneumonia before ever getting the H1N1  This is such bad planning right across the board  WHAT A JOKE! I read an article where it says that people who don't get the N1N1 are irresponsible  I am going to be irresponsible because I ain't waiting out in the weather 

collin
I believe that it was poorly thought out to have the flu shot clinics  They were in such a rush to get the vaccine out to the public and it was poorly thought out  To only have nine location for Edmontonians and Calgarians is wrong  I personally believe they should of had them in each community at a school gym  I don't have patience to wait in line up to 4 hours to get the vaccine  So I may not get the vaccine 

getting the shot
I believe the biggest problem they're having is staffing the clinics without reducing services elsewhere 

The highest risk groups (elderly young children and immune compromised) should be the first to get the vaccine 

I plan to get it but will wait until those at higher risk have had a chance to get theirs 

Worried mom
As a mom to one child with disabilities and medical issues I'm not going to stand in long lines with her as she can't even stand for three hours straight 

Now that being said
even though they opened more clinics  Honest truth- they could of done better 

This is poorly planed out ( all individuals who are high risk IE elderly Medical & Immune compromised) should be first then rest of the general public

Phil
I hope people will remember all of these health care hiccups when the next Municipal and Provincial elections come around  Maybe a voting booth right next to the vaccination booth would send a strong message 

Danielle
The main problem is that there is mass fear with the H1N1  I think it's important to vaccinate but think that they should have done the high risk patients first and then offered it to other Albertans  People - stay home for a couple of days to let those who absolutely need this vaccine get it first! I plan to go in a week or so to vaccinate my family 

Raymond
Why do all the people have to drive to the clinics at all? Wouldn't it make more sense to dispatch nurses to the schools like in the old days and vaccinate a whole gym full of students at once? Why not do the same at seniors facilities? Why does the governments have to create chaos with parking line-ups traffic etc  It does not make sense to create large crowds of people in the same place when you are trying to fight a pandemic 

gunther
The solution is simple: DON'T GET THE SHOT!

John
This is terrible planning by Alberta Health Services - 5 locations for the whole city!

They should expand the service to Senior Centres where seniors and those over 55 at high risk can get their H1N1 vaccine  They don't need to stand in line for hours on end 

Trish in SW Calgary
Living in Calgary or Edmonton should be easier to get the H1N1 Flu shot  Due to extremely poor planning the province again is made to look unprepared!

Why can't the shots be offered in places that can handle the crowd and are inside where it's warm 

Brian Stevenson
Proof our heath care system doesn't work in Alberta
They can't even handle vaccinations properly 

Sam
Health nurses are scrambling right now  The vaccine wasn't supposed to be available this early  They need to book places to give the vaccines and get schedules for workers in place  It is not an easy job giving hundreds of needles in a day! Hands and arms get sore giving that many injections! I think we should thank our health care workers who are doing their best in difficult situations 

newjack
Do people not realize that Calgary and Edmonton are HUGE cites? There are going to be line ups people!! The vaccine is here to stay! Why do people flock to these places and expect to be helped right now?? Why not wait a few days?

I see that Dr  Gerry Predy isn't through with his fear mongering tactics  He needs to meet his target so now there's a 'third' wave on the horizon and it that doesn't work maybe a 'fourth' by spring  All the international information out there seems to be acknowledging that this 'pandemic' had peaked and that it has not turned out to as destructive as first thought  Maybe Mr  Predy should just let folks enjoy their holidays and and lay off with the grim reaper campaign

My family just got over having H1N1  Although this flu might have been a bit harsher than most  We survived it and are getting on with our daily activities  The health officials and the Gov't are making it seen like we are signing our death warrants if we don't get vaccinated  Whatever   !! My youngest child is 4 months old and survived it just fine without being injected!!

How Dare They   
   want to give us something that may help to prevent serious illness or worse! And for free yet    Ridiculous isn't it? Frankly I would agree with all the perceptions that this thing has been horribly over-hyped through the media seemingly fear-mongering  BUT even so this vaccine doesn't cost anything so if it has even the most remote chance of protecting you why shouldn't you get it (if not too inconvenient)?

My family recovered from the H1N1 flu just over a month ago  It was by far the worst flu my family has endured  My young boys 7 and 9 were hit the hardest  They are otherwise healthy active young boys - this flu hit them like a truck  The onset was very rapid less then a hour from helathy to unable to breath  Very difficult to watch my children suffer so greatly  I wish they had been vaccinated

H1N1 is not waiting for after Christmas it is the xmas season that is going to cause the 3rd wave because of family and friend get togethers  That is how the predict it  Yes many of you have had H1N1 and lived to tell about it  The virus is unpredictable and has caused the deaths of many people  Just because it wasn't so bad for you doesn't mean that people should not get the vaccine  By you saying that it minimizes the fact that healthy people have died  You do realize that the world does not stop in your little corner right Carol and Leah? Show some respect for those that have died and thank god it was not you or a loved one  I really do not understand why people would not want to protect themselves against this but I do respect EDUCATED and thought out reasons for not getting it

    it doesn't matter how the govt handled the shots  people are going to be upset no matter how they did it  funny how you never hear how many did get shots  grow up and get it in your head you don't get the province done in a week unless you shut down the entire province  can you just shut down work for a week? didn't think so

    My wife went to H1N1 vaccine clinic being held at PLace Cartier in Hull Quebec  She works as a daycare worker for children  Most of which are under 6 years old 
    With not a single other patient in sight  No line up to stand in at all  She was refused and told daycare workers dont qualify 
    Strange that according to Quebec CLSC she did qualify  Several of her friends who also work as child care workers in Ontario got the H1N1 flu shot no problem 
    But she is an Anglophone living in Quebec I guess that must be the real reason she doesn't qualify  It's totally disgusting that some how NHL hockey players can jump the queue and qualify but a child care worker in Quebec does not

    After months of the media charging up the panic levels of the populace about the urgency of getting this shot is it really a surprise that this was so poorly planned from the start? There's problems here someone MUST be held accountable someone else MUST be fired!
    Right?
    No no instead we play the blame game some more to divert the publics attention from the main issues  We need a scape goat!
    Why didn't they obtain enough of this inoculation to give to EVERY single person in Canada? Regardless of class level societal role or occupation no one wants to die from a flu bug  It's just that simple 
    I am left wondering who will stand to profit from the shots that have already been provided and for the rest that still need to be administered?

    but im taking a wild guess here that cuz these two govts have used glaxosmithkline in the past for the las swine flu in 1976 they didnt want to overstep glaxo to set out for japaese biz of wat a scietist had found there--but since that finding from that japanese scientist im sure there country will be on the high of using such an effective vaccine by using osteoporosis meds in their country

    The issue here IS the way the vaccine was distributed 
    Why are no other provinces experiencing this problem?

    Not execute it while trying to figure out a plan!
    Some provinces are just beginning their vaccinations because they took that extra time to PLAN!

    Duckett said officials are expected to announce a new plan today to vaccinate those in the high-risk category first -- pregnant women children under the age of five and those under 65 with chronic health conditions -- before allowing the general public to get shots again 

    So if you're 66 and asthmatic you have to wait but if you're 65 and asthmatic no problem? Wouldn't asthmatics be more at risk regardless of age? Sounds to me like the program is being administered by poodles

The public has been scared stupid for the last two weeks about getting the H1N1 that who wouldn't say they were high risk just to get it?

    With a 9 month old & 10 year old asthmatic it is ridiculous that I as their mother will not receive the shot with them this week (YES I did my share of line standing!)
    WHO will come to my house to care for them if I get H1N1?
    Obviously it would be me to care for them in the event the shot was not effective for them with NO safeguards in place for myself!

    the government and the media have spent months convincing the general population that if they got H1N1 they could die told it was their 'civic duty' to get the vaccine and now they're supposed to feel guilty for getting it?

    And when someone does die from the flu are they ensuring that it is H1N1 and not seasonal or will they mark every flu-related death as H1N1?

    The vaccine should have been given to doctors offices so they could administer the vaccine to all of their high risk patients and it should have also been administered to all the students in shools across the province 
    There should have also been a place where you could have filled out all your paperwork in advance (preregister) maybe on line would have made the process a lot faster 
    If you were getting your vaccine you waited in a long line and after a two to four hours wait then you registered and went and waited in another line for a couple of more hours 

    The nurses are doing the best that they can 
    The blame I think starts and ends with the government

    I think what people are forgetting is that the vaccine program was started 2 weeks early the vaccine was okayd by health canada the friday before the program started so common sense thinking would state that the company making the vaccine would not have a bunch stockpiled in case the vaccine was not approved  As for standing in line well I distinctly remember ads that stated that if a person was not in a high risk group then they should wait untill that group was done so to eveyone complaning maybe you should have dressed warmer and brought a chair along  I think that everyone from government to the media to the public all share blame for this

    It would be good to get some transparency from the Alberta Government  Liepert now has changed the # of vaccinated from 300000 to 400000 just above 10% of the population  Now that the government has decided it will fulfill the agreement they signed in 2006 (National Pandemic Plan) to distribute the H1N1 to the priority people first (well for us I guess it's an afterthought) - Liepert was asked how many Albertans fell into this category? Eventually he quoted the Chief Medical Officer who estimated about 30% of Albertans  Ok - so week one did 10% the next 2 weeks we have limited supply - that puts us into the last week of November when we start to tackle the other 20% priority - unlikely everyone else gets it before Christmas

    I am certain that the government is mostly responsible for the mess  You can't blame those who are afraid and yet willing to be a responsible person and taking the shot not to mention waiting in line for hours  Firstly they should've asking only the high risk group to come forward period  But they didn't do that they kept telling us that no one will be turned away  No wonder everyone is confused  Secondly those manage the clinic should have learned how to manage line up better making seniors and children waiting outside in the cold for hours is simply unjustified

    Most of this problem is the people who showed up for these clinics who did not fall into a high risk category  The health authorities actually believed that those people would wait their turn so they did not set up screening  They should have known better and turned people away from day one  It is not all the governments fault  I hope every person who came to a clinic knowing they were not high risk realize the shot they took away from someone who really needed it may result in a catastrophic illness

    I look at it this way  The government uses the media to get certain messages out there  Just last week someone used the media to tell Albertans that if they didn't get the vaccination they were being irresponsible  If the process had been correctly coordinated from the beginning 400 000 high risk people would have been vaccinated and not a bunch of people who could have waited til later  All parties should be held accountable for this not the people who followed directions  I believe that the projected 150-400 deaths came from someone in the Alberta governement and not the media  If you look back you'll find the article that reported it  Can't blame the sun for everything  Right Fred?

    The government vaccinated 400000 people last week and we're calling for people to be fired  Maybe we should look at society and start questioning why everyone is only concerned with me myself and I  Does everything have to be handed out and explained to us on a platter by the government or are there still people out there who can think for themselves  Maybe we should be calling on the media to take the blame for embelishing the 400 people that will die from H1N1 when that is not an outragious number for seasonal flu deaths  Why can't we have a culture that looks to work together if there are issues instead of blaming somebody else for anything that doesn't please us  Maybe it's time to stop putting our trust in man and TRUST GOD

    I wasn't able to ge the H1N1 shot due to me and my kids being sick  I am in the high risk category have a 15 month old and a 6 year old  So since now they are saying that pregnant women and children from 6month- 5 years are only getting the shot right now   But why can't the family get it done while waiting   It would be so hard to stand in the line up again for 3 times!!!! It is crazy i say    They should let doctors give it so we can go to them as well  The health minister needs to set up a better way for people to get the shot other than just going to health clinics or designated places

    For the stupid person who said they lost their job becuase they missed the time change and was late for work  The clocks went back and hour you idiot so you should have been an hour early for work 

    I don't fault the Alberta government for how they delivered this vaccine in the beginning  It would have been fine if there was not a shortage  H1N1 kills healthy people in their 20's with no other health concerns as well so why should they be denied the vaccine  If Canada could supply enough of the vaccine in a more resonable time frame then it would not be a problem  As for waiting in line get over it  People wait in huge lines for hours to go on rollercoasters and to get concert tickets so suck it up

    First the person who blamed the paper for being late for work  Take some responsibility 

    Second this is typical government double talk  They got it wrong  Did not organize properly and allowed the public to dictate the terms in which the vaccine was too be given  A sorry from government officials is in order and this includes relatively healthy individuals who decided that their welfare outweighted those who really needed the vaccine

    I have Chronic Kidney Disease and my immune system is compromised  I have been unable to get the vaccine  While I was standing in line on Sat  I over heard a healthy looking 30ish man complaining to his buddy that half the elderly shouldn't be in that line up since many of them will pass this year due to other diseases anyway  I was disgusted that this type of mentality is going  I was then turned away after the province shut down the clinics on Sat  There should have been proper screening in place to begin with  I work in the school system which places me at an even higher risk   I and others in high risk can die from this flu those without compromised health might get sick but likely won't die yet they felt they were more important

    I cannot believe that the government is blaming the public for this fiasco by saying that it's our fault that low risk catagories were not letting high risk individuals in  Well lets see what were the instructions at each clinic? Why were low risk people being let in in the first place? Why the sudden change of tune? Last week up to 400 in Alberta were going to die from this  They spread the panic they put out the statistics and they weren't clear from the get go  The decision makers have themselves to blame for this  This is the process that should have been followed from the beginning the egg is on THEIR face  I for one won't forget when it comes time to vote!

    I am saying no to the shot after doing much research online  All sources I have checked agree that the Swine Flu vaccine contains the toxins formaldehyde mercury and squalene  Some sources also say it contains a tracking microchip  For any number of health and religious reasons I will have none of these things in my body!
    Doesn't it strike anyone as odd that Baxter Pharmaceuticals could patent a Swine Flu vaccine a full year before the outbreak? Doesn't anyone ask why a laboratory re-created the Spanish Flu virus that killed millions in 1918? What about Guillain-Barre Syndrome?

    Personally I have decided to wait to get the h1n1 vaccine beacuse I am unsure of its contents and longterm side effects  The virus has been around for quite sometime and I havent contracted it yet so whats the rush?? These people waiting hours upon hours have seemingly lost their minds  It is unfortunate that this disease has claimed the lives of several ppl in Canada but so has the seasonal flu pnemonia maleria to name a few   I think its great that we have the technology to mass produce this vaccine and i'm sure all the people behind its making are very proud of their work but does noone remember the avian flu and how many lives it took?? Why is everyone in such a state of panic? People as a whole worry to much 

Worth the risk Report Comment
    October 28th 2009 10:04am
    a multi-dose vial of the H1N1 flu vaccine contains about 25 micrograms of mercury per dose  In comparison an average can of albacore tuna contains about 60 micrograms of mercury 

    Which countries were people infected with HIV as a result of tainted vaccinations? That would come from medical procedure not from the vaccine itself and Canada has a sterling reputation on vaccinations 

    Its nothing like playing Russian Roulette  Yes there are risks but the risks are minimal and worth it when balanced next to the symptoms of H1N1  At the very least think of the senior citizens and young children you come into contact with  Sure it's not lethal for most healthy individuals but for them it is a life or death situation

    I've been researching the good and bad weighing my odds and I happened to stumble across some interesting stuff  Like did you know the vaccine contains mercury? Ok    here's another did you know that in some countries people were accidently infected with such diseases as HIV as a result of tainted vacinations (not just H1N1 btw)? Now I'm not cutting people down who go out and get it but I for one am not going to wait in a long line up and put my life in the hands of a vaccine  I'm not being arrogent here I'm just being practical  When people make things it invariably has problems  It's like playing Russian Roulette and when making my decision on getting vaccinated I asked myself what scares me more? Vaccine scares me more

    Has this been Confirmed by the Medical examiner?????
    Is this a confirmed case????? or is it Possible that every one is jumping the gun till all the facts are in?
    I have never heard of any Medical examiner come up with such a fast conclusion in such a short time frame!
    Is there so sort of new test that has come up that can diagnose the H1N1 so fast 
    Every time i here that there is going to be an autopsy to confirm a cause of death it usualy takes a day or two just to have that autopsy done and then it still takes a couple of days for any results

    Enough of your paranoia Dan  You are obviously woefully uniformed in terms of basic science  Vaccinations have saved millions upon millions of lives and it is apparent you are not old enough to remember smallpox polio and the likes nor does it seem you bother to read history 

    If you bothered to check we order 50 million vaccinations as researchers were cautious conservative allowing for 2 vaccinations (like 5 years and under require) to achieve immunity  This by the way corresponds to herd immunity enough vaccinations to cover 2/3's of the population (approximately 25 million Canadians)

    I live in another city and am a pregnant woman who was vaccinated last night  The clinic was full of pregnant women and small children and many of us waited between three and five hours for our shots  I went at the recommendation of my OBGYN as we've got H1N1 circulating around our city and people show up in my office sick on a regular basis--their little cold could kill me and my unborn child if its H1N1 

    Apart from a sore spot on my arm and being tired from waiting in line yesterday I've had no side effects  I'm not sure what everyone is so worried about   H1N1 doesn't cross the placenta and the adjuvant in the vaccine has been used over 22 million times in Europe in other vaccines with no serious complications if you check on things

I plan to wait a week at least to see if there are any reported issues with the vaccine  I have asthma and should be considered one of the first to get vaccinated however after reading these comments I feel it is important to wait and see  Places like Japan have done clinical trial testing on medical staff to see reactions to the vaccine  In Canada no such testing took place  I'm no guinea pig  So just have to wait and see

    Oh I am not telling people nor encouraging people to not get the vaccination  I believe that all should take the time to educate themselves on both sides before vaccinating themselves  Unfortunately at this time we have not had the time to educate the pros or cons of the vaccination but what we do knw is the the goverment thinks we should and is telling me in the form of media on the news radio commercials and floods of forwards on line  Thankfully I have made a personal decision on my own years ago not to participate in vacinations at this time therefor made my mind up before the media decided for me

    I think the heard of sheep in Canada are following two ways to the get the shot or to not get the shot  Our country is divided in whether to get it or not  I don't thing anyone should be on here telling people what to do with there lives  We all have to live with the choices we make  Everyone should be doing there own research and make sure they are making an informed decision  But for god sakes people stop telling everyone they are wrong for getting it or wrong for not getting it!

    Jesse I'm with you and as for the insults being dished out to you i think some are just realizing that they are following like a heard of cattle to the vaccination stations and if their not realizing it than i hope for them they dont follow the heard right off a cliff one day  If i happen to take a wrong turn and walk myself off a cliff at least I know it was from my own chosen actions that i arrive there and not that of the governments 
    As for wishing illness upon others I'm sorry but do you have a hall pass to be out of class and on the internet right now kids??? Good thing for Jesse the universe will not differenciate for whom they wish the illness upon just that they are calling the illness  We all manifest our own life situations

    No H1N vaccine for me thanks  The vaccine was sent out and ready to go out to the public awaiting approval to have the heards injected you cant tell me there was no rush nor pressure to approve that 
    Dee are you telling me that after two weeks or less all side effects should have shown by now & if not there are none? Where do I find the book of facts with this rule or is it mor like the unspoken 5 second rule? You jump on Jesse for wasting health care funds in the case he is sick well if he is like me the type to not abuse they system and stay home in bed get fluids & lots of rest when sick rather than support those crucks at the pharmaceutical companies 
    I believe the waste of funds comes from the mass panic to get this injection

    Sorry i gotta say this I am not Ignorant when it comes down to my own family and i look at everything first before jumping onto the band wagon  If i was ignorant i wouldn't weigh the unknown risks to the benefits  Like come on i spent 4 hours in the Emergency room yesterday with my 2 year old daughter and pregnant wife with people all around me wearing mask's  lol really Dee am i that ignorant?

    Some say its a 1 in a million chance that you can get GBS (Guillian Bar Syndrome)
    For those that dont know what GBS is:
    GBS is a â€œrare neurologic disorder that has elements of an auto-immune condition in that some trigger (usually an infection or rarely a vaccination against an infection) results in a progressive weakening of nerves

    I've thought long and hard about getting this vaccine and have decided that I will not be getting it  I don't feel comfortable subjecting my unborn child to something that has unknown long term side effects  I also don't understand how it can be safe when things like asprin and peppermint oil can be considered dangerous and should be avoided for pregnant women 

    I also would have been quite angry if I stood in line for 4 hours waiting to get the vaccine while people not in high risk groups were ahead of me  (wonder how many people will get sick from standing in line?)

    So my fellow Edmontonians  i just have this to say: Get the shot at your own risk because the Government has given the company that made this shot a Waiver to prevent lawsuits

    bitten - if the H1N1 mutates than you certainly can catch it again but then the vaccine is based on the current H1N1  If you did catch the flu it was almost certainly H1N1  But the only way to know if it was the flu would be if you are tested

    I have been bitten by the flu bug  I have been home for the past 6 days resting and getting over it  I have not gone to the doctor instead I called Health link and followed their advise to stay home unless I get worse  Is it H1N1? I have no idea and will probably never know  If it was then the immunization was a few days too late for me  On the good chance that it was just the seasonal flu I will be lining up with the rest of Edmonton to get my shots  Don't worry though I will not get in line until I am fully over the flu I already have  A question though   can a person catch H1N1 again if they have already had it?

    The government sat on this issue since late last winter and this is the best that it could do? Come on five 'clinics' for the entire city? When I drove by Westmount this morning there must have been some 500 people in the line-up  I didn't stop  A couple of comments  Many people had to stay away from work to get vaccinated  If the time off was at their own expense why? If it was not imagine the expense to employers  Something more important strikes me as utterly ironic though  Here we are trying to head off an epidemic that spreads from person to person  And what happens? Hundreds are forced to huddle in a tight group waiting for hours to be immunized  Isn't this the best way to catch what you are trying avoid?

    Let the high risk people go first   NOT every senior needs it But they seems to be the majority in line  This flu is worse on the younger people   yet it seems the old people are pushing everyone out of the way  NOT acceptable 


    Those who will benefit most from immunization include:

    â€¢People under 65 with chronic health conditions and their caregivers 
    â€¢Pregnant women 
    â€¢Children six months to less than five years of age and their caregivers 
    â€¢People living in remote and isolated settings or communities
    â€¢Health care workers involved in pandemic response or the delivery of essential health care services 
    â€¢Household contacts and care providers of persons at high risk who cannot be immunized or may not respond to vaccines

    Cold Lake did not recieve the H1N1 flu shot today! We took the time to go down with our children and friends listened to the radio to confirm that the shot was available here and when we showed up there was a small sign on the door that said No H1N1 today
    What the hell? The rest of Alberta gets it but not us? Are we too far north for this shot?
    After calling both Cold Lake health clinic and Bonnyville health clinic we get the same story   we aren't sure when we will be getting it try calling another day or listen to the radio

    I hear and understand peoples' concerns about availability & distribution of the vaccine  This process has been in our provincial conservative government's and AB Medical Association's hands for years and they still can't even come close to a viable and practical solution  Stelmach and previously Klein have made no friends in the Alberta Medical Association and vice-versa  Hence the distribution and administration problems  That said the Association has an oath  Prove me wrong

    Could Alberta Health Services tell us how 782439 people in Edmonton are supposed to get the H1N1 flu vaccine at only 4 clinics in Edmonton? (Calgary has only 3 clinics ) Itâ€™s statistically virtually impossible to vaccinate everyone at only 4 clinics when time is of the essence to prevent an epidemic  Itâ€™s also a great hardship for people to travel all that way (especially seniors people with disabilities and people without cars) to be in long lineups outside in the cold  Alberta Health Services should have had the foresight to have the H1N1 vaccine available at all health clinics and doctors' offices so the vaccine could be administered to everyone as soon as possible before people become infected & an epidemic potentially occurs

    That's all very nice that they're having five clinics for a metropolitan area with over a million people  Be ready to take the day off form work to stand in line 

    I'd like to know why AHS has decided not to send Public Health into facilities for the elderly infirm and physically and mentally handicapped  These people are at high risk due to pre-existing health problems and they are unable to properly cover their coughs and sneezes  And if they don't have family or staff members who are willing and able to schlep them to a clinic they're sitting ducks  Even if they're lucky and only get a mild case of H1N1 they're going to share it with everyone they come in contact with before anyone knows they're sick  It's reprehensible ",,,,,,,$$$

Default Re: Swine H1N1 antigen/adjuvant bait and switch?
Even though I fall into the group of adults under 64 who have qualifying conditions to receive early vaccine I will not be vaccinated unless enough data about the vaccine itself and the clinical trial results are disclosed 

As someone who tried the early hepC treatment I am skeptical 
Not only was it not a cure quality of life while on treatment and for several months after stopping was far worse than the condition it was taken for 
I know a few people who have not survived the disease but more whose lives were damaged or lost due to treatment 

The combination of bad flu vaccine and a terrible doctor left me with mild COPD/lung damage a few years ago 

Unless I know enough about the vaccine and possible complications someone else can have my dose 

No blind faith left here

Something is fishy between this article below and the one above  Are they planning a bait-and-switch claiming antigen production has increased to calm the general population while instead using new adjuvants?
I wonder whether this post from FrenchieGirl may explain part of the change:

http://www flutrackers com/forum/sho   78&postcount=1

Here's an excerpt red bolding mine:

Quote:
Vaccine makers currently developing vaccine candidates for the pandemic
swine flu using egg-based and cell culture technologies have advised the WHO that the influenza seed strain used to produce their new vaccine is not
growing well and therefore giving poor antigen yields  The yield is
approximately 25-50% of that vaccine makers typically get for seasonal flu
vaccine production  The WHO recently made a new set of seed strains using new viral isolates such as the California/07 in hopes of increasing the vaccine yield  Medicago's vaccine is produced using its VLP technology that does not require a virus and therefore does not rely on the ability of a viral strain to grow

Quote:
Yields of antigen the key vaccine ingredient have increased and that should ease pressure on vaccine manufacturers said Robin Robinson chief of the Biomedical Advanced Research Development Authority the U S  agency in charge of buying the vaccine  Vaccine makers previously reported antigen yields 50 percent to 75 percent less than that of the typical seasonal flu shot 
It appears the initial reports were correct  According to yesterdays's FoxNews report

Quote:
As of Wednesday only 11 million doses had been shipped
That's less than 10% of the vaccine supply promised by mid-October 

But the stories about low antigen yield seemed to have evaporated in late July

This was a well-organized protest  They were prepared with call-and-answer chants and took turns making noise so that only a few were ejected at a time - until security figured out the whole Gallery was in on it  But no they did not hurl anything - in the past protesters have dropped flyers on MPs from the Gallery but this was bigger and better than anything I've witnessed

Braying like idiots from the gallery is not free speech (especially since they were semi-immediately ousted and some were assessed fines by summons)  It is imposing on all the obligation to pay attention to you  Not at all the same thing

When I was a kid who went to protests people used to shout this at us even though most of us had found some way to take time off work to be at the demonstration  You know that Archie Bunker was a parody not a role model eh hollinm?

I was really struggling with my opinion on this one  Thanks for clearing up that respect of institutions vs  peaceful act of protest thing for me 

Parliament is the place where The People conduct their business  Parliament as such should be respected  However it is not a place for the elite power players to behave however they like i e  disrespectful of The People then get all upset when some of The People behave in the same manner 

In fact while I know this isn't what these particular protesters were protesting I think it would be awesome if every question period that deteriorates into catcalls heckling and questions that can have no answers or answers to everything except the question--the gallery did this same thing  Throw it back at them until respect is restored

Well it's good to know that despite their posturing to score points on the subject both sides of parliament believe people should be getting their flu shots  The Conservative message on the H1N1 vaccinations while a bit half-hearted has been adequate - even if they gave it their all there would still be plenty of people wearing their tinfoil hats 

And since the subject was brought up we could really use 50 more MRI machines

Aaron I think your description of the exchange between Baird and MHF is pretty selective  He actually took down Hall Findlay quite hard – he tabled an email from her parliamentary office sent to all MPs offices to solicit funds for Martha’s leadership dept – they said they wanted to “shamelessly” raise funds through the Liberal Party’s website  This is the kind of thing that is the subject of a Conservative complaint about the Liberals to the Ethics Commissioner  She admitted she screwed up   but as Baird said    “when Liberals do it it is always a mistake and an error  When the Tories do it it is always a conspiracy

Same ole' granola crunching nut jobs who want western civilization shut down  Thet want the energy sector completely shut down because they think it doesn't affect them  They don't work there(or anywhere else) and they think the power to run their laptops that daddy bought them appears magically out of a hole in the wall  What a pathetic useless bunch  If they object to a modern western civilization I suggest they might like Albania I understand the lights are hardly ever on there is no industry and people leave no carbon footprint whatsoever  Somehow I don't think any of them will be signing up for that anytime soon  Truth is they like a nice warm bed in the morning so they will be well rested to get up at the crack of noon and go protest things they expect others to provide for them for nothing  Cheers

      Is Thimerosol and mercury the same thing? How much perservative is in the vaccines?
   2  Jill Says:
      November 5th 2009 at 2:33 pm

      I was really worried to get my son the vaccination before  He is 16 months old and i wasnt sure what could happen to him if he got it since its a new vaccine 
      This article is reassuring that it is a good idea to get it 
      I think the the protection from the vaccine will outweigh the risk of getting it 
      Also since I’m not a stay at home mom I am more likely to get it and pass it to him and also him get it from the daycare so I feel that women with their children exposed to the public alot should highly consider getting vaccinated 
   3  Lindsay Says:
      November 6th 2009 at 11:29 am

      Hi Marni - Thanks for your question  Thimerosal is a preservative that does contain a small amount of mercury  While higher doses of certain forms of mercury may affect brain development the IOM review concludes that thimerosal-containing vaccines do not 
   4  Lindsay Says:
      November 6th 2009 at 11:30 am

      Jill you’re right  If your child is in daycare the exposure risk is much higher  Thanks for your comments 
   5  Dr  Pedre Says:
      November 15th 2009 at 12:50 am

      I’m concerned about the statements here with regards to the safety of Thimerosal in vaccines  The amount in the vaccines may be small but the amount that the EPA and the CDC considers safe for daily exposure is in micrograms — quite small  Thimerosal is ethylmercury which is an inorganic form of merucry however some of this will be converted to methylmercury by the body and then it has no way of getting back out  For a developing fetus you have to consider that the level of exposure is much greater than in an adult body as its volume of distribution is much smaller  At EPA acceptable levels the amount of mercury in the vaccine is too much for a fetus  In fact if you read the vaccine package insert (readily available on the FDA website) you will see flu vaccines are considered a Category C in pregnancy  This means it has never been tested in pregnant women and therefore its safety is not known for sure 
   6  Lindsay Says:
      November 17th 2009 at 2:46 pm

      Hi Dr  Pedre  Thank you for visiting News Moms Need 

      It’s important to note that the seasonal flu vaccine has been around for many years been given to pregnant women and shown to be safe for most women during pregnancy  Millions of Americans including pregnant women get the seasonal flu vaccine each year without any problems  The H1N1 flu vaccines are made in the same way as the seasonal one  To be doubly careful National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the vaccine makers have conducted more rigorous tests on the H1N1 vaccine than they normally do on other flu vaccines  The clinical trials which included testing on pregnant women have shown that the new H1N1 vaccine is both safe and effective for pregnant women and babies  Several prominent health organizations such as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) the American College of Nurse Midwives (ACNM) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) have each recommended that pregnant women and children get both the seasonal and H1N1 flu vaccines 

      The thimerosal used in some flu vaccines is in a very small amount  In fact the amount of mercury in vaccines with thimerosal is less than what babies normally get through breastmilk or infant formula  As I mention in my post medical experts from the Institutes of Medicine (IOM) have thoroughly researched the issue and concluded that thimerosal-containing vaccines are NOT associated with autism 

      You’re correct that the U S  Food and Drug Administration (FDA) assigns a letter grade (A B C D X) to prescription medications and treatments  In general most medications and treatments are not tested on pregnant women in a traditional setting (clinical trials studies etc )  However a category C medication or treatment doesn’t necessarily mean it’s unsafe for pregnant women  As the FDA notes the benefits of a category C medication or treatment during pregnancy may outweigh any risks  And that’s what pregnant women need to keep in mind –the benefits of both the seasonal flu and H1N1 flu vaccines on you and your baby’s health far outweigh any potential risk 
   7  Mr Research Says:
      November 17th 2009 at 4:56 pm

      Lindsay
      very good information however many people yourself included seem to forget the mercury in the vaccine is injected into the body which is different than entering in your body through consumption and must go through your stomach acids intestinal track and liver 
      Nonetheless I tend to agree that the Mercury content is not a cause for concern in small dosages however what about taking the vaccine every year?
   8  Lindsay Says:
      November 20th 2009 at 10:25 am

      Hi Mr  Research -

      I discussed this with colleagues and it’s important to note that the amount of mercury in vaccines is very small even if multiple vaccines are given over many years  In the future the H1N1 vaccine probably will be included with the seasonal flu vaccine so this will mean fewer shots and less exposure  And if someone still is concerned mercury-free versions are available

      No mother or child should receive the flu vaccine or swine flu vaccine when it comes available  There are 14 5 to 25 micrograms of mercury in flu vaccines  One microgram is considered toxic  In receiving flu vaccines will increase your infants chance of developing autism ADHD asthma and other neurological disorders  Keep your immune system strong by eating healthy food taking quality supplements and getting plenty of sleep 
   3  Pam Says:

      Dear Deborah:

      Flu vaccines are now available without mercury  So if you or others are concerned please ask your health care provider for a mercury-free vaccine  A mercury-free version of the swine flu vaccine will be available 

      You raise an important issue that has been much debated  Several years ago some people were concerned that vaccines containing a preservative with mercury might be linked to autism and other health conditions 

      Since that time much research has been done  A large majority of health experts now believe that such preservatives do not pose a serious health risk  At the same time manufacturers have started making mercury-free vaccines 

      When considering any medical treatment we have to weigh the risks and benefits  Almost all medical professionals believe the benefits of vaccines outweigh the risks they carry  Vaccines prevent very serious diseases that can be life-threatening

I agree with 'cao' I called my GP surgery last week (as I am 10 weeks) and they had no idea whether they would be receieving supply of the vaccine and when  I find it quite troubling that the NHS and all the health authorities like the WHO are saying it's critical for pregnant women to get the vaccine but then GP surgeries seem to be very much behind the ball in contacting high risk patients or even having any info on timelines  Surely there must be a plan for this and GPs have been properly informed of process and timings before the NHS makes sweeping statements to the public about the need to be vaccinated?

My GP surgery does not yet have supplies of vaccine nor does it know when the vaccine will arrive  Surely there is a rollout schedule for supplying surgeries which could then be used for priority patients to book appointments  The current dearth of information does not engender any confidence in the system  I am 35 weeks pregnant and have not been able to ascertain when I might be able to get the vaccine or if there is an alternate route to the GP surgery

Sheribump    I agree with you   I am 36 weeks pregnant due Oct  13  Will I also miss the high risk group for the swine flu vaccine? Myself and both my kids have had the seasonal flu shot about 2 weeks ago but what about the H1N1 vaccine? I also think that prenant women that gave birth winthin 2-3 mos should still be high risk    how can we care for our newborn if we are sick or how do we tell if our newborn is sick? My son who is sick today has swine flu symptoms      now I 'm concered for my 3 yr old? Should I start taking tamiflu even though i do not have symptoms?? I agree with you and know where you are coming from

im concerned that i wil miss being high risk group as my baby is due the 26th of october are the vaccines avalible before then ?? surely if u have just givin birth within the last 2 months your still high risk as your immune system is still gettin back to normal also not getting a lot of sleep which is also not good for fighting infection and how do they expect a mum to care for a new born if they are ill with flu and they can also pass it on to a newborn baby ?? also i have no idea what to look out for in a new born as they cant exactly tell me if they have aches or are shivery can they what should we do to help protect and diganose our new borns ????

Swine Flu A Hoax But Martial Law All Too Real    The H1N1 virus itself has claimed less lives than a normal flu outbreak would be expected to kill but the architecture of martial law in the form of draconian measures readied to combat a pandemic has been firmly locked into place 

Health authorities are now toning down their apocalyptic predictions of a swine flu pandemic after the virus proved to be milder than originally feared but officials are warning that a deadlier form of the illness could return in autumn or winter

Corruption I fully Agree  The swine flu is a flu like the others  Our body's immune system will deal with it  If not  survival of the fittest  My wife and I along with our kids will never get the flu shot  I can remember being sick when i was a kid big deal  What is in this shot and the fact that they cant even tell you if its going to be effective is disturbing  As well it may kill you  My family will take their chances the all natural way  And if the government wants to restrict my kids from going to school well ill home school them

Besides the fact Medicine has advanced a little in the last 33 years the CDC can not force vaccinations on people who don't want them  Unless a national medical emergency is called the most that can be done is they would refuse to allow your kids to go to public events and school   and rightly so     I don't want my kid catching something potentially deadly from yours at school because you buy into some conspiracy theory

Exposed: The Swine Flu Hoax I fully believe that the current swine flu epidemic is being blown way out of proportion  Yes people will get sick and yes people will die  That's typical every yearly flu outbreak  What I'm terrified of are the threats of mandatory vaccinations which in themselves are a hazard  They haven't gone through the rigors of normal testing  We run the risk of a repeat of what happened with thalidomide  With the 1976 swine flu outbreak there were more deaths from the vaccine than from the flu itself  As news has been floating around about this it seems it will be mandated for school aged children (including preschool children)  There are huge what if's associated with it and I'm not comfortable knowing that I have a preschool aged daughter who could die from the vaccine  In the middle of the initial scare she did get sick  She had a runny nose  Adults who were around her had pneumonia like symptoms  Mine were bad enough that I had to be treated by a doctor who gave me the option of being admitted to the hospital  I don't go to the doctor for very much but when I'm unable to breathe that's enough to send me looking for help  Was it swine flu? I don't know  Despite the news that you could be tested samples being sent to the CDC for confirmation were relatively rare  I was examined prescribed and released  My doctor knows that I'm not terribly demanding and usually when I show up it's for a good reason  I isolated myself in the house until the symptoms were completely gone 


Conspiracies are running rampant of what the possibilities of government mandated vaccines  I do understand that conspiracy theories are frequently sourced by paranoid delusions but sometimes they have a basis in reality  If we are forced to take a vaccine for something that may simply make us ill and we would build up a natural immunity to it's better to let the natural immunity happe",,,,,,,$$$

Swine Flu shots are available and are being given to ALL childrenseniors and at high risk adults between 24 - 65  I wanted to dig deeper into this situation before I setup an appointment with the pediatric nurse for vaccination  I am always skeptical about new medicines and side effects which is the scary part 

I was worried as the child is going to be a guinea pig  So did some research to dig deeper about any known side affects of any vaccines in any corner of the world 

In this situation even if I beg to be the guinea pig I won't get vaccinated as I fall under Healthy adult category next is side effects could be totally different in different age groups 

VoilÃ ! Surprisingly Swine flu is not new  This scare was there in 1976  of course we have a different approach in this Millennium better research and FDA testing and guidelines not to forget a list of 'Lessons learned' from the research of those days  When it comes to the idea of vaccination still swine <vaccination> gives chills to my spine

Dear All -- Scientific Prevention of Swine Flue using Household Products :

1  Inhale clove (Lavang) oil for one second
2  Chew one clove in a day
3  Eat raw garlic onion ginger (0 1 to 0 5 gm)
4  Drink hot milk with 2gm of turmeric
5  Consume plenty of Vitamin C Fruits: LemonAvala(Amla) or Vitamin C tablets also available by name celin
6  Drink plenty of water and Do Pranayam for atleast 15 min a day to increase resistance power and to have control on respiratory system

Les infirmières qui vont être mutées de leur poste vers la vaccination massive ne seront pas remplacées (pénurie)  Est-ce qu'une évaluation de la réduction des services a été faite? Il me semble que ça devrait rentrer dans l'évaluation coût-bénéfice de la vaccination  Moi je suis TRÈS curieux de voir une vrai évaluation coûts-bénéfices au Québec genre:
50000 grippes H1N1 et 100 morts sauvés pour 300 millions 1 millions d'effets secondaires divers 20000 consultations manquées 2000 chirurgies pas données 25 décès provoqués par manque d'effectifs les liste d'attentes rallongées 5000 cas de grippe régulière de plus car vaccination reportée etc

En fait si c'est comme en 1976 il y aura plus de morts chez ceux qui se font vacciner que chez ceux qui se font pas vacciner  

À ce sujet c'est malheureusment un argument difficile à tenir  Si le vaccin a effectivement fonctionné il aura réduit la propagation et le nombre de complication  Donc la possibilité existe que SANS la vaccination massive il y'aurait eu plus de mort

Si vous êtes allergique demandé la version sans adjuvant l'agent chimique  Cependant cela pourrait prendre deux doses puisque la réponse immunitaire sera moindre 

@llaurick
La quantité de mensonge semble provenir bien plus d'Internet que des médias  Le moment où la grippe H1N1 a tué plus de gens chez les vaccinés que chez les non-vaccinés varient de 1918 (avant l'arrivé du premier vaccins contre la grippe) à 1976 selon les diverses sources  Si les médecins et infirmiers basent leur jugement clinique sur ces informations puis-je douter de leur jugement?

@Parush01
Le taux de population affecté par le syndrome Guillain Barré est de 04 à 4 pour 100 000 habitants par an  Pour le Québec on parle de 320 personnes au plus 32 au moins  10% de ces 320 meurent 15% restent infirme soit 32 et 48 personnes respectivement  Les chiffres sont 3 et 5 personnes pour un taux de 04 par 100 000  Si le taux de mortalité du A H1N1 reste le même au Québec soit 3% des cas et que la prédiction est juste 35% d'infecté on parle de 84 000 morts  Même avec un taux d'infection de 5% on parle de 12 000 morts!

À prendre le vaccin vous avez 0001% de chance de mourir ou d'être gravement malade  Sans le vaccin cela oscille entre 015% et 105% de chance 

Dans les deux cas vos chances sont minimes

premierement ''La grippe A (H1N1) se traduit le plus souvent par des symptômes comparables à ceux de la grippe saisonnière  Un petit nombre de personnes infectées développent toutefois des complications qui nécessitent une hospitalisation  Dans les pires cas la maladie entraîne la mort ''

alors pourquoi s'affoler c'est comme la grippe saisonnière non il le disent prestiquement eux meme!

deuxiemement c'est quoi cette idee (que je trouve) stupide de vacciner les gens dans des endroits publique comme si c'était pas assez sale deja allons empirer les choses sincerement moi je trouve sa niaiseux de faire sa dans des places publiques  Deja que le centre-ville de mtl ou de quebec ou nimporte quelle autre ville grouille de microbes et certainement de H1N1 allons vacciner les gens la bas dans tout sa  bon bref en tk moi sa m
sinon ben j'ai une question moi  il doit y avoir des gens qui l'ont la grippe H1N1 tres faible ou ils pensent que c'est jsute un grippe normale et les gens qui ont le rhume etc etc etc    c'est pas dangereux qu'il recoivent le vaccin s'il sont malade? c'Est peu etre pas tres bien expliquer mon affaires     mais si quelqu'un arrive a comprendre

Questions pour Philvalois:

Les chances d'avoir le H1N1 seraient d'environ 1 sur 3 selon vos informations 

Il y aurait donc 2 800 000 personnes infectées pour une population de 8 000 000  Est-ce que ce modèle représente le cas où personne ne serait vacciné ou l'inverse?

Vous dites que 3% des cas en mourraient soit 84 000 personnes  Quelles sont les chances de simplement développer des complications sans en mourir?

Si l'on s'intéresse simplement aux cas à risque: femme enceinte etc  quelles sont les probabilités de développer des complications et quelles sont les chances d'en mourir?

Enfin quelles sont vos sources?

En réponse à robertp en 1976 40 millions d'américains se sont fait vacciner sous la présidence de Gerald Ford car il y avait une alerte de pandémie de H1N1 comme aujourd'hui  Apparemment le vaccin aurait provoqué la maladie de Lou Gehrig chez 500 personnes  On pense aussi qu'il aurait causé 30 décès  Deux mois après le début du programme la vaccination a été arrêtée  Au total il y a eu plus de morts chez ceux qui se sont fait vacciné que le population non vaccinée  Ca aura été un énorme FLOP! C'est drôle que personne parle de CA dans les médias  Toutes les infirmières et tout les médecins le savent pourtant!

Alors vous vous demandez encore pourquoi plus de la moité des infirmières et des médecins se font pas vacciner?

En ce 21 Octobre 2009 le Canada tel qu'il était écrit a homologué (lol) le vaccin avec adjuvant pour les enfants de six mois et plus et le suggère même aux femmes enceintes 

Combien d'enfants seront atteint de problèmes graves et permanents de santé avec cet adjuvant dans les années à venir??

Oui dans dix ans il y aura plus d'autisme plus d'hyperactif mais surtout et cela est nouveau plus de maladies auto-immune chez nos enfants 

Moi et plusieurs collègues avont consacrés des centaines d'heures afin d'aviser la population sur les dangers de l'adjuvant chez les femmes enceintes et les jeunes de moins de trente ans 

En tant qu'humannitaire nous avons fait notre possible mais nous savions d'avance que nous ne réussirions pas à changer quoi que ce soit à ce qu'il avait déjà été décidé 

Maintenant nous allons poursuivre nos recherches de façon pro-active pour trouver des options de traitements sur la prochaine vagues d'émergence des maladies consécutives à cet adjuvant 

Ceci est donc mon dernier commentaire sur ce vaccin et je réitère ma requête auprès de la SRC d'inviter deux trois immunologues sur les impacts de l'adjuvant surtout chez nos enfants les Premières Nations et les Femmes Enceintes 

Pour une dernière fois je vous invite tous à notre Forum Médical

Avant aujourd'hui je ne m'étais jamais posé la question à savoir si les vaccins en général étaient bénéfiques pour moi 

Si ça n'avait été de tout ce battage médiatique autour de cette satané grippe la souche de la grippe AH1N1 aurait pu être simplement ajouté aux autres souches présentes dans le vaccin pour la grippe saisonnière et 50% de la population (parce que c'est bien le chiffre qui a été avancé par Radio-Canada) aurait reçu l'immunisation sans que ça ne fasse de remous  Mais non les choses ont dégénéré et voilà où on en est rendu: les gens sont méfiants  Je ne les blâme pas c'est tout à fait compréhensible!

Par ailleurs je n'ai pu m'empêcher de sourire quand j'ai lu le commentaire de l'internaute qui est allé en France et qui trouve que c'est encore pire là-bas et qu'on essaie de vendre au passant toutes sortes de trucs comme des vaporisateurs ou des masques aux passants  Il y aura toujours des gens pour faire de l'argent à la moindre occasion et la grippe AH1N1 n'est pas la moindre! La peur ça joue beaucoup dans les décisions des gens et la peur les poussent à se protéger  Rien de tel pour faire une bonne passe de fric 

Est-ce que je vais me faire vacciner? Sais pas encore je vais attendre  De toute façon j'ai eu la grippe cet été: 5 jours de fièvre maux de dos intenses etc  C'était peut-être le AH1N1 pas certain

@philvalois: Le taux de mortalité n'est PAS 3% des gens infectés  En fait lors de la dernière vague à Winnipeg 7000 personnes sont allés à l'urgence et 168 aux soins intensifs et une infime partie des gens aux soins intensifs sont morts  En calculant rapidement on peut voir qu'on est loin du 3%

Dans texte cité plus haut :
Le «médecin»      un drôle de lapsus       sans adjuvant destiné aux femmes enceintes et aux personnes dont le système immunitaire est défaillant n'a cependant pas encore été homologué  Quelque 18 million de doses sont néanmoins prêtes et sont entreposées par le manufacturier 
Question :
Si il n'est pas accepté  les compagnies vont reprendre leurs vaccins ?? ??
Si je regardes dans les années antérieures
J'ai connaissance de faits qui questionnent: Le vaccin de la polio est à l'origine de l'une des plus grandes bavures de l'histoire des vaccins  La présence d'un virus du singe  appelé SV40  provenant des milieux de culture des virus de la polio a contaminé des millions denfant entre les années 1954 et 1963 
Or ce SV 40 dabord considéré comme inoffensif et sest révélé responsable de nombreux cancers apparus plusieurs années après  Il est possible que le SIDA soit passé du singe à l'homme par la même voie 
La décroissance des nouveaux cas de polio s'est amorcée bien avant la vaccination de la population  
LA disparition de cette maladie ne justifie plus une vaccination systématique sauf si on voyage dans un pays endémique 

Tiré du livre : QUI AIME BIEN VACCINE PEU p  36 editions les pratiques de Jouvence  (collectif de médecins pédiatres et homéopathes)librairie Biosfaire

Et si c'était la même chose aujourdhui  on n'a la vue courte  
Si comme dans les traditions amérindiennes  on pensait en agissant aujourdhui en tenant compte de plusieurs génération après nous 
Surtout ne pas nuire est le serment de la médecine
Pourquoi a t-on si peur et ne fait -on pas confiance au processus naturels de chaque être vivants ? Une guérison s'est individuel 
C'est vrai que ça rapporte pas beaucoup d'argent !!!!! Sommes nous rendu là

En général je me fais vacciner environ un an sur deux pour la grippe  Avec cette version plus virulente qui cours et avec le nombre de gens qui evisage d'éviter le vaccin je crois que cette année en est une pour ne manquer le vaccin en question!

Pour les gens qui disent que ca vaut pas la peine car c'est pas pire que grippe saisonnière normale je ne comprends pas  Vous avez jamais eu la grippe ou quoi? Ça alors! Je l'ai eu une fois dans ma vie et j'espère que ce fut la dernière!

Bien sûr Parush vous avez une ou des sources pour backer vos affirmations et vos chiffres concernant le nombre de personnes affectés du syndrôme de Lou Gerihg et Guillain-Barré suite à la vaccination de 1976 aux USA ?

Si j'en crois le wiki suivant (oui je sais ça reste wikipedia   ) http://en wikipedia org/wiki/1976_swine_flu_outbreak  il n'est pas question de Lou Gerigh et de seulement 500 cas de Guillain-Barré non 4000 comme vous avancé

Très certainement! Vous pouvez gagner le gros lot au 6/49 (1 sur 13 000 000) et ne pas avoir de problème avec le vaccin (1 sur 100 000)  Ce sont deux évènements séparé sans rapport  Je vous suggèrent de taper probabilité sur google 

@Jebbou
Même avec un taux de décès de 01% si le taux d'infection au Québec grimpe à 5% on peut prévoir 4000 morts avec le virus ce qui est moins élevé que le taux de mort à prévoir à cause du vaccin soit 3200  Ces des spéculations seulement  C'est possible que le taux soit de 001% et que ça n'affecte que 1% de la population ou bien c'est possible que le taux atteigne 5% et que cela affecte 35% de la population  Pour faire mes comparaisons j'ai utilisé le taux le plus élevé de problème liée au vaccin en le comparant au taux le plus faible de problème liée au virus  Je constate qu'il y a plus de problème liée à la non-vaccination qu'à la vaccination  Mes chiffres peuvent être erronés mais ces calculs sont fait de bonne foi 

@Harfang_des_neiges
L'autisme n'est pas dû à la vaccination  L'autisme est un trouble génétique que vous avez avant la naissance  La hausse du diagnostique de l'autisme est dû avant tout à l'élargissement de la définition du trouble et à l'augmentation des ressources disponibles pour faire cette évaluation  Entre autre les psychologues du Québec auront bientôt le droit de poser un diagnostique psychologique permettant aux enfants autismes d'avoir accès à des services spécialisés au lieu de passer par des pédopsychiatres (augmentation des ressources disponibles)

Si oui alors pourquoi n'a-t-il pas été homologué avant? @ philvalois   tout ceux qui eu le virus avant que le vaccin soit «commercialisé» ont produit des anti-corps n'est-ce pas? Il y a eu 4700 morts MONDIALEMENT en combien de mois??? 8 ou 9 mois? Peut-ête plus? Et vous avez peur qu'il y ai 84 000 morts selon les chiffres que vous avez?

Ce qui est bien avec la planète terre c'est quelle a deux hémisphère sur l'autre face de la terre (qui n'est pas la chine mais bien l'Australie) ils viennent de sortir de cette grippe  C'est aussi le cas de l'Argentine et la Nouvelle Zélande trois pays ou la grippe aurait du cogner fort  C'est triste pour eux mais le fameux vaccins au squalène n'était pas disponible alors ils l'ont eu plein la gueule 0% de vaccination   l'hécatombe    heuuu finalement non 

Tout syndrome grippal confondu (H1N1 et autre grippes) furent de 2% H1N1 est une fraction de ce 2% ouf mon dieu quel hécatombe   

Combien de mort total? sur 40 677 348 habitants (merci wikipedia) 439 décès   
ça donne un taux de mortalité à cause de la grippe (H1N1 et les autres souches toute la gang ensemble de: 0 000010975 ou si vous préférez 0 0010975% 

De plus si j'avais 70 ans je lirais pas ces chiffres de la même façon si j'avais le sida non plus des groupes à risques 

@philvalois: bravo pour ton travail sur les chiffres mais on peut choisir de quels chiffre ont part aussi    pour le Québec qui est grosso-modo 5 fois plus petit que l'argentine (en terme de population) je présume 100 morts de H1N1 gros maximum

J'aimerais bien savoir cependant si c'est vraiment le H1N1 ou la grippe saisonnière qui a causé son décès et quel était son état de santé 

Mais je doute fortement qu'ils aient pu faire ces tests et obtenir des résultats aussi rapidement 

S'il est justifié de mentionner ce décès durant cette conférence de presse il me semble qu'il serait normal d'en savoir plus ou à tout le moins de savoir si elle a vraiment été testée pour savoir quel était le virus qui a présumément causé son décès si c'est vraiment le cas

Le problème est que vos chiffres sur 1976 semblent fortement erronés  La même chose a été dite pour 1918 soit que le vaccin a tué plus de gens que le virus lui-même alors qu'il n'existait pas de vaccin contre ce virus à cette époque! Pour ce qui est de vos faits si ce sont les mêmes que pour 1918 je préfère de loin mes calcules mathématiques  Et dans vos faits vous oubliez les millions de mort de 1918 qui n'avaient pas accès au vaccin    Quelques parts il faut faire des prédictions sur ce qui est possible d'arrivé  Mieux vaut prévenir que guérir dit le vieux dictons 

Autres points vous oubliez d'omettre que les gens peuvent développer le syndrome de Guillain Barré par une infection virale quelconque et non uniquement par un le vaccin  Même avec un taux de mortalité de 0% dû au virus Ah1n1 il y aura quand même entre 04 et 4 personnes par 100 000 infecté qui seront atteint du syndrome  Dans le pire scénario le 35% du gouvernement c'est 112 personnes affligés à prévoir mais c'est effectivement moins que ce que pourrait faire le vaccin si le taux de mortalité du virus Ah1n1 est près de 0%  Sera-t-il prêt de 0%?

@FatherLogan
Désolé mais parfois la confusion règne sur ces forums  Je n'étais pas chaud-chaud à l'idée de me faire vacciner mais en lisant différent commentaire comme Harfang_des_neiges ou d'autres qui énonce des énormités comme quoi l'autisme est dû au vaccin que le vaccin c'est du poison etc j'ai de plus en plus le goût d'y aller  J'ai plus l'impression que mon inconfort face à la maladie en générale n'est rien vis-à-vis ce qui peut être lu 

@équilibre
Effectivement 84 000 morts peu être une chiffre trop élevé  En réduisant à une propagation de seulement 5% avec un taux de mortalité de 001% c'est 4000 morts au Québec  Le 84 000 morts a été évalué avec un mauvais taux de mortalité mes excuses  Le site http://www billet-medical com/grippe-ah1n1-passage-au-stade-6/ parle de 2% de complication grave  Le 001% de","Envoyé par danieltardif

Si jamais on en venait comme dans certains pays ou même d'autres provinces (sachez que la vaccination courante des enfants est obligatoire dans les autres provinces) comment ferait-on pour obliger les gens à se faire vacciner  Si je ne le fais pas l'armée débarque et me vaccine de force? On me met en prison si je ne le fais pas? Quoi?
Les infirmières pourraient se voir obligées de se faire vacciner sous peine de refus au travail  Comment fera-t-on pour savoir si elle sont vaccinées ou non? Devront-elle présenté leur carnet de vaccination (il pourrait être falsifié facilement) ou tiendra-t-on un registre des infirmières vaccinées  Combien cela coûtera-t-il? Et pour remplacer dans les hôpitaux celles qui refuseront de se voir imposer cette décision?

Bonjour à tous
Je me pose une question peut-être quelqu'un parmi vous povez me renseigner???
je me demande de quelle manière ont-ils pu découvrir un vccin contre A(H1N1) en si peu de tempssoit à peine 3 mois (Août 2009) alors que ça fait plus de30 ans que l'on tente de découvrir un vaccin contre la VIH 9Sida)  Selon moi mon opinion personnel il y a anguille sous roche quelqu'un veut se faire de l'argent sur le dos des contribuables est-ce les gouvernement (ou et) les compagnies  Alors à qui profite ce vaccin? Ma conjointe et moi travaillons tous deux sans le domaine de la santé auprès des patients à l'urgence et nous avons décider elle et moi ainsi que nos deux enfants de ne pas se faire vacciner et plusieurs de nos confrères et consoeurs de travaille ferons de même  Ce qui nous rend confus
dans notre décision d'aller ou pas me faire vacciné c'est que certains spécialistes se contredisent entre eux à savoir la dangerosité du vaccin j'ai l'impression que c'est un vaccin de derniere minute et meme les spécialistes ne sont pas convaincus de ces effets sur l'etre humain 
Que vous soyez d'accord ou pas c'est mon opinion perdonnelle

Dans le livre The new Economic Disorder à la page 200 (Pour bien citer nos sources) on peut lire que la dette domestique totale des états unis est de 43 trillions  Et la monnaie d'échange pour payer la dette (M-2) est d'un peu plus de 8 trillion   

Ces chiffres datent d'il y a environ 1 an mais depuis la situation a empiré depuis avec tous les plans de sauvetage sous Obama  La situation aujourd'hui est juste pire 

La question est de savoir comment est-t-il possible de payer une dette de 43 trillions plus intérêts avec 8 trillions d'argent disponible pour la payer? Réponse: Soit le gouvernement imprime une tonne d'argent et crée une inflation monstre ou il déclare faillite 

C'est quoi le rapport avec la pandémie vous vous dite? C'est que l'économie est sur le point de mourir et on ne pourra plus nous cacher la vérité encore longtemps    Et la pandémie tombe tellement à point avec cette économie qui a l'élastique sur le point de petter   Donc soit cette pandémie est un complot ou ce n'en n'est pas    Mais une chose est certaine c'est que l'économie ne supportera pas à une pandémie (grande ou petite) qui fait des morts pour vrai combinée avec cette campagne de peur organisé par les médias   Les gens n'iront plus travailler n'y dépenser et tout va tomber 

Si on prend le temps de connaitre la réalité économique comme bien des gens le font sur le H1N1 ou la vaccination c'est fou ce que l'on peut apprendre    Et ca devient évident qu'il y a un lien entre la pandémie et un effondrement de l'économie  L'économie c'est complexe mais ca repose sur une logique et des lois mathématiques  C'est plus facile d'y voir clair que de chercher la vérité sur un virus où on a un tas d'oignon mais rien de vraiment concret 

Pour tout ceux qui se sentent d'avantage désinformé qu'informé par nos médias je vous recommande d'essayer de comprendre la situation économique    Et un moment donnée la logique parle d'elle même    Vous trouvez réponse à vos questions sur la pandémie

À votre gouverne cet adjuvant se nomme aussi adjuvant AS03 L’adjuvant AS03 est un amplificateur d’effet qui consiste en un mélange de squalène de polysorbate et de vitamine E  C'est ce type qui a été utilisé en 1976 afin de contrer une pandémie (qui n'a pas eu lieu) de grippe porcine   

Pourriez-vous partagez avec nous votre source selon laquelle l'adjuvant AS03 ou un autre adjuvant à base de squalène aurait été utilisé en 1976?

Il semblerait plutôt que les premiers vaccins grippaux avec adjuvant à base de squalène (MF59 dans ce cas) ont été développés dans les années 1990 (chez Ciba-Geigy et Chiron) et l'un d'eux est utilisé en Europe depuis 1997 sans aucun problème reporté  AS03 est un adjuvant est encore plus récent qui a été testé chez environ 45 000 personnes  Il est intéressant de noter que le squalène est une substance naturelle chez l'homme produite par le foie et propagée dans le système sanguin 

Quant au fameux vaccin de 1976 je croyais qu'il ne contenait pas d'adjuvant? Je n'arrive pas à confirmer ceci mais quelqu'un d'autre pourrait-il m'éclairer à ce sujet?

Je ne doute pas de votre bonne foi mais plutôt de la validité de vos sources

J'aimerais bien que quelqu'un me renseigne si la dame de 87 ans de la rive sud de Québec dont ils ont annonçé le décès lors de cette conférence de presse est vraiment décédée de la grippe et si oui de quelle souche et quel était son état de santé au préalable 
As t'on au moins fait des tests pour soutenir cette affirmation?

Mais il parait qu'on ne peut pas le dire 
Ah bon !!!

Alors pour quoi utiliser cette nouvelle au tout début de cette conférence de presse?

je me demande de quelle manière ont-ils pu découvrir un vccin contre A(H1N1) en si peu de tempssoit à peine 3 mois (Août 2009) alors que ça fait plus de30 ans que l'on tente de découvrir un vaccin contre la VIH (Sida) 

Faut pas comparer des pommes et des oranges  Le méthode moderne pour développer le vaccin contre l'influenza (utilisant des oeufs de poule pour produire des virus inactivés) a été développée dans les années 40  À chaque année il s'agit de répéter le processus avec les souches saisonnières pour créer un vaccin efficace  Ce qui est compliqué ça n'est pas de produire un vaccin efficace c'est d'en produire en quantité suffisante pour répondre aux besoins 

Le VIH c'est une autre paire de manche il joue à cache-cache avec le système immunitaire il a un taux de mutation si élevé que l'on voit l'apparition de plusieurs variantes du VIH dans un même individu en une seule journée  Donc toute tentative de vaccination échoue puisque même si l'on réussit à stimuler le système immunitaire l'empreinte du vaccin ne correspond plus à celle du virus dans l'individu  Pour l'influenza on n'a pas ce problème: le virus reste plutôt le même sur une longue période

Je vous suggère une lecture complète du vaccin sur le site de Santé Canada  Ceci est en anglais puisqu'indisponible en français!!!!! Et oui!


Voici l'adresse url originale:
http://www hc-sc gc ca/dhp-mps/prodpharma/legislation/interimorders-arretesurgence/prodinfo-vaccin-fra php#a51

Au point 3 0 une réponse à plusieurs questions concernant les tests cliniques on ne nous indique pas le nombre d'adultes testés et les effets secondaires ont été évalués sur seulement 6 jours on se fie surtout aux tests de h5n19-grippe aviaire( vous devriez donc descendre la page jusqu'aux effets indésirables graves suite au vaccin h5n1 contenant le même adjuvant):

Il y a actuellement peu d'expérience clinique avec Arepanrix ™ H1N1 et l'expérience clinique limitée avec une formule d'investigation d'un autre vaccin avec adjuvant AS03 contenant la même ou d'un montant légèrement plus élevé de l'antigène dérivé de A/California/7/2009 (H1N1) (voir rubrique pharmacodynamie) chez les adultes en santé âgés de 18-60 ans et encore aucune expérience clinique chez les personnes âgées chez les enfants ou les adolescents  La décision d'utiliser Arepanrix ™ H1N1 dans chaque groupe d'âge défini ci-dessous devraient tenir compte de l'étendue des données cliniques disponibles avec une version du vaccin contenant l'antigène H5N1 et les caractéristiques de la maladie de la pandémie de grippe en cours 


De plus on nous dit dans les interactions que de faux positifs peuvent être obtenus pour d'autres maladies auto-immunes   
INFORMEZ-VOUS avant de laisser décider d'autres gens de votre santé

Tout cela est un calcul de risques et c'est votre décision  Une décision se prend avec tous les côté de la médaille et pas seulement avec ce que les médias communiquent 

Quoi de mieux que le site de Santé Canada!!!
Encore faudrait-il qu'il soit disponible dans votre langue officielle    mais c'est un autre débat!

Le squalène est un lipide naturellement produit par l'humain(et autres bestioles D ) Cependant celui qu'on tente de nous induire ne l'est pas bien qu'il soit animal 
C'est le contenu total de l'adjuvant utilisé dans la vaccination qui m'inquiète

Dans la section toxicology à la page 11 il est noté que Glaxo-Smith-Kline avoue que l'adjuvant AS03 à des effets nocifs sur les foetus de rats et que cela est assez évident pour démontrer sa toxicité 

Ainsi il est évident et même reconnu par Glaxo-Smith-Kline que cet adjuvant est toxique en ce qui concerne les dangers pour nos enfants GSK répond par un silence assourdissant 

Mais GSK reconnait que l'adjuvant AS03 provoque un délai dans le développement neurologique chez les animaux 

pour jf54321:
Je dois en effet me rétracter puisque j'ai mal traduit et mélangé 2 sources entres autres sur http://www ctv ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20090724/vaccine_faq_090725/20090725?hub=Health  J'en suis désolé et ferai d'autant plus attention à l'avenir  Le vaccin de 1976 ne contenait pas d'adjuvant tel que jf54321 l'a spécifié  C'est le vaccin de la grippe à lui seul qui a causé ce désastre sans même qu'il y ait un adjuvant

Le problème avec elle et plein d'autres c'est que les supposés experts ne s'entendent même pas  Le experts dont elle parle c'est ceux qui sont en position d'autorité pas nécessairement ceux qui ont la vérité  Le Collège des médecins est pas mieux  Il somme les experts qui ne sont pas en faveur deu vaccin de se taire  C'est-tu ca de la science?

Si le vaccin pour la population en générale ne sera pas disponible avant décembre et qu'il faut deux semaines avant d'avoir une protection il me semble logique de mettre en place des mesures minimales pour éviter les bains de foules  Actuellement dans les écoles il n'y a aucune restriction sur les activités de groupe   la propagation va venir des écoles bien plus que des groupes à risque 

La priorité devrait aller dans les écoles maintenant

Vous dénigrez les Québécois sans raison 

Rappelez-vous l'excellente gestion de la crise du verglas alors que Lucien Bouchard était au pouvoir et le comportement responsable et exemplaire des Québécois  Le problème actuel est qu'il n'y a pas de leadership et de directives claires adressées à la population  C'est le ministre de la santé en personne qui a dit à la télé que tout le monde qui se rendrait aux endroits indiqués était pour être vacciné alors que force nous est de constater qu'il ne pouvait pas livrer la marchandise  La frustration des Québécois est justifiée

Raison de plus pour éviter de rassembler des foules car ce virus se transmet facilement par voie aérienne 
Une autre incohérence de la santé publique 

SI vous êtes dans un autobus ou tout autre transport en commun et que quelqu'un est atteint vous êtes à peu près certainement contaminé 
Ce qui ne veut pas dire que vous serez nécessairement malade

Même là rien pour s'afoller car statistiques à l'appui il est moins mortel que la grippe saisonnière

Je vous annonce la date officielle ou la pandémie sera terminée 
Le 12 février 2010 ou quelques jours avant  Il n'y aura plus aucune trace de cette pandémie plus aucun risque tout va être terminé 
Pourquoi ? C'est simple les jeux olympiques 2010  Il y aura un rassemblement monstre d'individus ( athlètes et journalistes spectateurs   ) venant de partout dans le monde  Donc j'imagine qu'un gouvernement responsable qui tient à coeur la santé des gens ce gouvernement annulerait les jeux si il y avait un risque pour la santé  Ce malgré les pertes énormes du point de vue monétaire  Et comme notre gouvernement est responsable le bien être des gens passe avant l'argent 
Je vous le dit tout sera terminé en février 2010 il n'y aura plus de danger avec la H1N1  C'est juste de valeur que les jeux ne débute pas plus tôt la pandémie finirait plus tôt  :)

« Au cours des prochaines semaines si les gens qui ont un risque faible de contracter une maladie grave pouvaient attendre quelques semaines [le temps d'attente] s'améliorerait et [le vaccin] pourrait être administré à ceux qui sont le plus à risque » a dit le Dr Butler-Jones 
_________________________
C'est n'importe quoi  Après avoir alerté la population depuis des mois sur les risques de pandémie et la necessité de se faire vaccineron nous dit maintenant que le virus frappe et que les cas répertoriés doublent chaque semaine:
Attendez c'est pas grave !
Si ça continue ils vont avoir les vaccins disponibles une fois que la saison de la grippe sera passée!
Toute cette campagne autant les lieux choisis pour vacciner les gens que la disponibilité des vaccins de même que la campagne de peur qui a préçédée sent l'improvisation et l'incompétence à plein nez!

ATTENTION  Pour enlever un peu de panique  Il y avait hier au Téléjournal de Radio-Canada une interview avec deux jeunes médecins qui ont vécu la grippe H1N1 qui a frappé l'Australie au printemps dernier sans aucun vaccin disponible pour la population 
Il y a eu plusieurs personnes touchéesmais le taux de mortalité a été dix fois inférieur à ce qui était prévu  Les deux médecins ont tous les deux faits la grippe et bien que les ressources hospitaliaires aient été mises à contribution au maximumelles ont suffit à la tâche sans qu'il n'y ait eu besoin d'ouvrir des centres de soins parallèles

On a commencé avec un complot pour faire la piasse en vendant un vaccin pour une maladie inventé  Maintenant certains en sont à un complot pour endoctriner la population et comptabiliser le résultat    Des fois certains devraient se relire en prenant un peu plus de recul 
C'est tellement intriqué que c'est à peine cohérent  Endoctriné à quoi? Et pourquoi!?

On justifie cette réflexion en invoquant le peu de probabilité qu'un si grand manque d'organisation soit accidentel  C'est vraiment donner trop de crédit aux gouvernements  Personnellement je peux croire sans AUCUNE difficulté qu'un gouvernement se plante royalement en temps de crise  Et ce n'est certainement pas une première

Intéressant cet article  Il n'y a pas de raisons d'avoir plus peur de cette grippe qu'une autres  Ce n'est pas la peste bubonique  Pour ma part j'applique la meilleure prévention connue je me lave régulièrement les mains au savon ordinaire  Je travaille dans un endroit public je suis utilisateur quotidien du transport en public et je ne m'énerve pas pour autant  Je suis juste prudent  Je n'irais pas me planter dans une file d'attente dans une salle bondée dans une foule dans la rue etc Malgré ça j'ai quand même eu un rhume v'là 2 semaines et je l'ai refilé à ma compagne  C'est fini et on n'est pas mort 

D'un autre côté j'ai subi le virus du Nil il y a 5 ans et ça m'a alité pour une semaine à grelotter de fièvre  Je vivais en campagne à ce moment loin des foules  Un jour les maringouins ne m'ont pas raté  moins de 48 heures plus tard je faisais 104 de fièvre et mon corp me torturait  Évidemment que je ne tiens pas à contracter cette grippe pas plus que n'importe quelle autre mais je n'en fais pas un cas  Si jamais je l'ai ben coudonc advienne que pourra j'ai confiance que je m'en sortirai vivant  Pour aucune raison je ne me ferai injecter ce kool-aid Jim Jones 

Sur une note farfelue il y a même des swine flu party en Angleterre où des gens préfèrent la contracter tout de suite afin d'être immuniser pour cette hiver croyant que la grippe sera plus virulente à ce moment

La grippe H1N1 a fait 5700 victimes

Il me semble qu'il serait normal élémentaire et éthique de rechercher et écrire le nombre de décès attribués à la grippe saisonnière l'an dernier durant la même période à titre de comparaison 

Jamais je n'ai entendu cette comparaison dans un média alors qu'il me semble que ça va de soit de comparer dans un travail journalistique correct surtout en regard de l'hystérie collective actuelle

C'est étrange  Depuis la crise du verglas puis le 11 septembre 2001 nos bons gouvernements nous disent qu'ils ont des plans de gestion de crise  On a vu ça à la Nouvelle-Orléans avec Katrina  Il y a 2 ans environ le ministère de la Santé envoyait aux entrepises du Québec un épais dossier comprenant vidéos etc  afin de préparer la population en cas de pandémie  L'avez-vous vu cette documentation ? Avez-vous déjà entendu parler de gestion de crise avant qu'elle ne survienne ?

Vous qui proclamer haut et fort que le virus AH1N1 n'est pas plus mortelle que la grippe saisonnière je vous met au défi d'expliquer la différence entre les deux virus et de donner les statistiques de mortalité pour les 30 dernières années pour chacun d'eux  Je vous donne un indice : la grippe saisonnière porte mal son nom car bien qu'elle soit saisonnière elle n'est pas un virus spécifique plutôt plusieurs virus 

Si vous faites un bon travail vous devriez conclure qu'il est difficile d'affirmer que la mortalité liée à un virus est plus faible que l'addition des taux de mortalité de plusieurs virus 

C'est sûr que 1000 morts causée par différents virus est plus élevé que 800 morts par un seul virus (cas de figure)  Lorsque l'on fait des proportions par contre pour chaque virus le AH1N1 est-il moins mortel?

Ce que je trouve déplorable de toute cette campagne pour la vaccination     c'est l'information qui a circuler dans les médias et qui circulent encore et qui a pour effet d'alarmer la population    voir de créer une crise  Il manque de vaccin il y a des files d'attente des petits gars en santé qui joue au hockey sont mort (sans résultat d'autopsie) n'a que pour effet d'encourager les gens à se précipiter pour se faire vacciner    priorité ou pas 

Sur une autre chaîne de télé une maman affirmait avoir fait la file avec ses deux gamins (5 ans et 1 an et demi) hier et encore aujourd'hui et ce depuis 8 heures du matin (il était 11h00 au moment de l'entrevue et elle n'était toujours pas vacciné) pour recevoir le vaccin  Trois heures debout a attendre avec deux très jeunes enfants      Est-ce moi mais la procédure de vaccination n'est pas adéquate  Est-ce normal qu'une maman doit faire le pied de grue durant deux jours tôt au petit matin pour faire vacciner son enfant 

Les élections (provinciale fédérale municipale) durent une journée et tous le monde vote en une journée  Mettre des centres de vaccination par secteur n'aurait pas été plus adéquat  Bien sur pas assez d'infirmière     n'aurait-on pas pu demander aux étudiants en médecine en infirmerie n'aurait-on pas pu former plus de monde pour administrer le dit vaccin  Dans plusieurs villages il existe des premiers répondants  Ces personnes n'auraient pas pu être disponible pour veiller en cas de complication  Je m'interroge 

Lors de cette même mini entrevue la maman affirmait vouloir le vaccin car son petit de 5 ans le demandait     il a dit a sa maman ''je ne veux pas mourrir''  Il a 5 ans et a peur de mourrir de la grippe  Quand des ptits bouts de 5 ans affirment avoir peur de mourrir    et demande le vaccin il y a certainement un problème au sein de la famille (on doit rassurer nos enfants   et à 5 ans tu te dois d'éviter que les enfants soient alarmer par de la désinformation) mais n'il y a t-il pas un problème de société qui a largement emplifier l'état de crise  Je m'interroge encore

Au Moyen-Age quand une armée voulait prendre rapidement une ville assiégée elle balançait des corps de pestiférés par-dessus les remparts pour infecter les assiégés 

Quand l’Angleterre voulut prendre la Chine elle fit en sorte que l’opium soit répandu dans ce pays pour les affaiblir et cela marcha tellement bien qu’en plus de devenir maître du pays elle put développer un riche marché de la drogue 

Quand les Américains ces braves défendeurs de la liberté voulurent se débarrasser de tribus indiennes ils leurs donnèrent des couvertures infestées de la peste et des tribus entières moururent dans d’atroces souffrances

WOW ce H1N1 crée la plus grande paranoia que j'ai vu de toute ma vie! L'Ukraine qui instore la loi martiale?? Je comprends plus rien là c'est quoi qu'il se passe    RÉELLEMENT? C'est quoi qui se cache derriere tout ca? C'est a un point tel que depuis le dernier mois au dessus de 50% des grand titres de journaux sont par rapport au H1N1 mais malgré tout je ne connais personne qui ne l'a attrapé! À quand des entrevues avec ceux qui l'ont attrapé et qui en s'ont guéri sans problème? Je pensais qu'en situation de crise (si situation de crise il y a vraiment) il faut apaiser la population éviter de créer la panique généralisée  Pourtant c'est le contraire qu'ils font  Donc je me demande ce qui se tramme réellement car en vrai situation de crise les gouvernements tenterais de calmer la population et éviterais les gros titres tant que possible

Par souci d'objectivité les journalistes et les experts qu'ils interrogent pourraient faire l'effort de mettre les chiffres qu'ils dévoilent en perspective  De ce point de vue là je trouve que les médias sont subtilement tendancieux et cette attitude n'est évidemment pas sans rapport avec l'inquiétude de la population et sa réaction face à la situation

phivalois dit:

«Alors est-ce une demande exagéré de ma part que le taux de mortalité soit comptabilisé pour chacune des souches et que la comparaison soit faite sur la base des souches et non une souche vs plusieurs souches?»

J'aimerais bien voir ces chiffres moi aussi  Un fait intéressant à ce propos aux États-Unis la CDC (Center for Disease Control) a cessé de compter les cas de H1N1 en juillet dernier prétextant qu'il ne valait plus la peine de gaspiller des ressources à faire des tests et a déclaré que la H1N1 était la souche dominante  Des journalistes de CBS news ont eu bien du mal à obtenir de la CDC les chiffres réels des cas confirmés de H1N1 fournis par les différents états au moment de cette décision 

Quand ils ont enfin réussi à avoir les données de tous les cas soupçonnés ou présumés H1N1 au *plus* 17% était confirmé en labo comme étant du H1N1  Le reste soit plus de 83% était soit une autre souche soit pas la grippe du tout  De ces chiffres on a déclaré la H1N1 dominante?    La CDC a refusé de commenter

- Une journée on me dit que si mon enfant de moins de 2 ans fait de la fièvre (385 C) je dois me présenter à l'hôpital    le lendemain on me dit le contraire (2 directeurs d'hôpitaux de Montréal) 
- Un médecin dit noir l'autre dit blanc   
- Les gens se mettent à paniquer devant 3 cas en Ontario certes mais surtout devant la campagne de peur des services de santé

Quelle cafouillis monumentale en plus ils jouent avec la panique des gens via les médias c'est vraiment un scénario apocalyptique que de voir des gens faire la file pour être vacciné parce une substance dont nous ignorons le contenu les effets secondaires les interractions avec les autres médicaments et les effets a long terme  Les cobayes sont nombreux et ceux et celles qui disent qu'ils l'ont eu et que ça ne fait pas grand chose devraient attendre quelques semaines avant de se prononcer triomphalement aucune confiance en ces pharmaceutique qui vont en dégager d'immense profit en ces temps de dépression économique la $$$ au détriment de l'humain

«On a commencé avec un complot pour faire la piasse en vendant un vaccin pour une maladie inventé  Maintenant certains en sont à un complot pour endoctriner la population et comptabiliser le résultat    Des fois certains devraient se relire en prenant un peu plus de recul 
C'est tellement intriqué que c'est à peine cohérent  Endoctriné à quoi? Et pourquoi!?

On justifie cette réflexion en invoquant le peu de probabilité qu'un si grand manque d'organisation soit accidentel  C'est vraiment donner trop de crédit aux gouvernements  Personnellement je peux croire sans AUCUNE difficulté qu'un gouvernement se plante royalement en temps de crise  Et ce n'est certainement pas une première 

Mais bon la réponse va être que je suis un troll aveugle endoctriné et irrespectueux »

Bonjour Sebastien

J'abonde  Quelques nuances près mais c'est une analyse juste que vous proposez 

J'ajoute qu'il est étrange également qu'on ait tant dit que la santé publique achetait trop vite ne prenait pas le temps de faire ses tests etc  Et soudain devant le délais venu entre autre des tests menés    On dit que c'est de la magouille pour faire peur  Bref ça s'appelle faire flèche de tout bois en disant une chose et son contraire 

Quant aux accusations disant que les Pouvoirs font en ce moment des psy-ops de propagande je suggèrerais fortement à ceux qui y croient dur comme fer de ne pas trop nous répéter ça   

Personnellement je me sens de plus en plus un gros malaise à lire la succession d'arguments contradictoires (entre eux comme exemple que je donne plus haut) qui aboutissent dans ma boite de courriel ou dans les présents blogs 

Si vraiment la population commencait à croire qu'il y a des psy-ops qui ont lieu actuellement pour voir ses réactions elle va finir par se dire: «Mettons que c'est vrai    De quel côté de la guerre idéologique actuelle se trouvent le plus de testeurs de mon opinion et de mes réactions en me déstabilisant?»

C'est pas parce qu'un côté a l'air plus échevelé que l'autre qu'il doit être considéré au dessus de tout soupçon  Plus d'une fois en discutant avec des personnes logeant de ce côté elles me sortaient l'argument «L'autre côté fait bien sa propagande et son suivi  Pourquoi nous priverions-nous de faire pareil!»

Si on trouve que j'exagère surtout vérifier par soi-même  Il suffit de questionner solidement des proches qui sont bien en selle dans ce discours  L'argument que la fin justifie les moyens sortira bien assez vite

Je vous propose deux ou trois liens si vous désespérez un peu par moment de la tournure du débat  Des liens qu'on ne saurait taxer de pro-pouvoir ou des moutons 

Ça m'a fait un bien infini entre deux bourrées de travail en retard d'aller lire ces blogs plutôt que de me remettre ici à l'écriture comme il y a quelques jours 

J'espère qu'ils vous feront le même bien intellectuel et je formule le même souhait pour les autres lecteurs qui commencent à trouver exagéré de toujours lire que seul les pro-pouvoir ou les gens pas réveillés (ou qui sont la matière première de la laine) sont pour la campagne de vaccination 

Bonne lecture à tout ceux qui veulent d'autres points de vue:

Votre angélisme et votre confiance indéfectible pour le système est plus inquiétant que le scepticisme de ceux que vous condamnez  ben voyons les pharmaceutiques sont tellement des chérubins qui veulent tellement le bien de l'humanité et on a tellement pas le droit de douter de leur honnêteté  Vous avez raison  D'ailleurs on a perdu trop de temps à tester ce vaccin voilà qui explique tous ces retards  Heureusement que vous êtes revenus nous expliquer on commençait à désespéré de comprendre  Pourquoi diable ont-il tant voulu testé ces vaccins de GSK eux (GSK) qui ne veulent que notre bien?

Si un sdf se présente dans une pharmacie sans le sou et avec un mal de crâne impossible en suppliant de lui donner un paquet de Tylenol de GSK parce que ces derniers ont mis sur leur site que leur mission était de soigner les gens  Pensez-vous qu'ils lui en feront cadeau?

Écoutons ces nouveaux dieux qui ont remplacé les curés d'antan 
Mais au moins les curés d'antan n'annonçaient la mauvaise nouvelle qu'une fois par semaine  Tandis qu'aujourd'hui on nous répète cette mauvaise nouvelle au moins 24 fois par jour dans les chaînes continues de désinformation  Laissons-nous influencer par cette propagande qui a pour nom droit du public à l'information

Toi tu ne trouves qu'il n'y a aucun psy-ops (psychological operations) dans les médias? Tu n'as pas l'impression que les médias font une culture de la panique depuis quelques mois?

Si le tout tourne en véritable pandémie comme nos dirigent le pensent possible    Tu ne crois pas que les médias aurait le devoir morale de bien nous informer relativer les choses et d'essayer de calmer les peur non fondés? Mois j'ai plus-tôt l'impression que ca fait des mois qu'ils sont en train de crinker tout le monde    Pour provoquer une furie générale    Comme si nos dirigents souhaitent créer une panique totale    c'est vraiment pas normale ce qui se passe et ce n'est pas logique ce qui est en train de se passer  La théorie du psy-ops semble bien plus logique   

De plus ce n'est même pas une théorie c'est utilisé par la CIA et l'armé américaine

«@MicciM

Votre angélisme et votre confiance indéfectible pour le système est plus inquiétant que le scepticisme de ceux que vous condamnez »

Ravi de voir que vous argumentez sur le contenu et ne prêtez pas d'intentions personnelles en optant pour un raisonnement présentant des éléments concrets   

Vous n'avez aucune idée de ma capacité d'esprit critique  Aucune idée non plus si opter pour faire en gros confiance signifie avoir une «confiance indéfectible pour le système» 

Vous déduisez du fait que je suis en désaccord avec la façon dont certains exercent leur esprit critique que je me refuse à utiliser le mien? Quel argument fournissez-vous là-dessus?

Il n'y a pas monopole de l'esprit critique  Pour y avoir accès pas besoin de professer (et de ne surtout pas questionner) maints données et raisonnements émis de votre côté 

Ce n'est pas comme ça un vrai débat  On le sait bien 

Ce que je déplore depuis le début ici c'est le type de polarisation  Et le type d'arguments privilégiés et de sources priviliégiées par une bonne partie de ceux qui affirment qu'il y a fiasco 

Mais ça ne signifie aucunement que je considère la réponse actuelle parfaite 

Plutôt dans la présente tournure du débat j'agis de la façon qui m'apparait la plus correcte  Ne pas émettre mes propres critiques (même si elles me semblent plus nuancées que plusieurs de celles que j'entends) par dessus cette foire d'empoigne qui n'est plus un débat du tout 

C'est un choix personnel qui ne devrait présager de rien d'autre que de cela 

Ni angélisme ni liste de paye de boite de com ni que sais-je d'autre encore 

Je continue à croire que si des blogueurs qui ont au départ épousé avec conviction la plupart des arguments «critiques» anti campagne de vaccination durant l'été ont admis d'autres arguments dans leur réflexion pour finalement modifier leur opinion    ça a une certaine signification  Des gens progressistes parfois très engagés d'autres plus pondérés etc   

Fort difficile pour moi de penser «angélisme» quand je lis ce que dit un des participants du blog de Renart Léveillé  Ce participant médecin sur le terrain en toute première ligne vaut bien des arguments idéologiques d'un bord ou de l'autre 

(Mes guillemets à argument «critique» sont pour rappeler qu'il existe aussi plusieurs définitions de l'esprit critique pas de monopole ici non plus) 

Bon week end à vous et à tous

Ne vous inquietez pas  Ce vaccin ne sert a rien d'autre que de rempllir les poches de certains et a donner cette impression que le gouvernement veille sur le peuple  Si c'etait du serieux depuis le debvut on aurait mis en quarantaines des regions voir meme des pays  L'OMS (Organisation Mondialede la Sante)  Le virus H1N1 n'est pas si dangereux que la grippe saisonniere  L'influenza tu en moyenne 1 personne sur 1000 a 2000 peronnes contaminees  Le H1N1 a tue 1/14000 au maximum 

L'hiver vient de finir en Australie  Le H1N1 a cause moins de dommages qu'une grippe saisonniere  Si on fesait face a un risque serieux les gouvernement auront decrete l'etat d'urgence  Alors qu'on realise qu'ils vont peut-etre meme pas vaccine les gens selon l'agenda qu'ils ont annonce  Ce n'est pas parcequ'ils sont pas serieux  C'est tout simplement parceque ce n'est pas si vrai que ca: H1N1 a tue quelques personnes  Mais le deces est dans tous les cas cause par un facteur se condaire 

Il existe un domaine qui s'appelle epidimiologie  Un bon medecin de famille est a peine initie a ce domaine  C'est une facon de vous dire qu'il en connait pas grand chose 

Des Epidimilogistes reputes tel que Dr  Tom Jefferson (Sante Canada fait plein de erfernces ses travaux) ou bien le Dr  Marc Lipsitch (Harvard University) qui a agit en tant que consultant pour aider le gouvernement des USA a evaluer les dangers du H1N1 pensent que tout cela est exagere:

http://www thenewamerican com/index php/usnews/health-care/1901-h1n1-swine-flu-death-rate-is-low

Selon la communaute scientifique de maniere generale les deces associe au virus de l'Influenza ne representent que 7% parmis les deces du a des virus

«Tu ne crois pas que des multi-nantionales comme Baxter ou l'OMS n'ont pas les moyens de se payer des génies de la psychologie subliminale?»

Je n'ai absolument jamais dit qu'il ne se fait pas de manipulations  Je m'exprimais sur quelque chose de bien plus profond:

Ce genre de méga-projet de domination et d'asservissement d'envergure internationale (auquel faisait allusion Sebastien à qui je répondais) je ne crois pas 

Et je crois que cette opinion personnelle que partagent beaucoup de gens    ça ne mérite pas de me faire prêter des intentions ou de me faire dire que je me ferme les yeux 

Des psy-ops existent bel et bien sinon je n'en aurais pas parlé  C'est de dire qu'elles sont utilisées à fond dans ce qui se passe en ce moment qui ne me convainc pas  C'est de dire que ce qui arrive en ce moment a été mis sur pied juste pour mener ce genre de psy-op avec quoi je ne suis pas d'accord 

Et j'admets que oui (et c'est une opinion très personnelle) je trouve que dans ceux qui manipulent la peur des gens à coup de Grand Complot je ressens de plus en plus un feeling qu'on teste les réactions des gens  Qu'on semble vouloir les habituer de plus en plus à l'idée que le problème c'est ce Grand Complot 

Je ne me mettrai pas à lirer là-dessus  Ce n'est pas un dada à ce point 

Mais je signalais que je crois que ce genre de tentative pourrait créer un backlash des gens qu'on tente d'habituer de convaincre à coup de courriel et d'allusions sur la blogosphère 

Encore une fois ça n'engage que moi 

J'espère avoir clarifier des choses sur ce que je disais  Et je crois qu'en gros ça s'applique aux autres questions que vous me posez  En ce moment je n'ai vraiment plus le temps de me lancer dans des escarmouches comme celles d'il y a quelques jours

Juste un petite précision  Parce qu'il y a des «accusations» non fondées qui discréditent indument les gens dans un débat  On traite quelqu'un d'aristocrate et de classe dominante et la voilà rangé du bord des suspects 

Je ne sais pas où vous prenez les informations sur mon statut de salarié cher payé?

Vous vous sentez bien de répandre des choses comme ça ou bien vous avez l'impression que je l'ai dit quelque part?

Je n'ai jamais rien dit sur mon statut à ce sujet  Et je me fais très discret sur tout renseignement personnel sur le Net  À mon sujet et je respecte aussi ceux des autres 

Mais je ferai une très courte et discrète exception  Ce que j'ai gagné dans ma vie par année avoisine sérieusement le seuil de pauvreté  Juste un peu plus haut et encore je me le demande  Je n'ai pas eu encore le courage de faire la moyenne 

La privation je connais 

Et le statut de salarié m'est totalement inconnu

Pour le reste où ai-je dit ces choses et de cette façon? Je tentera de voir où  Si c'est durant les escarmouches ou les couteaux volaient bas des deux bords ça m'aidera de cibler aux jours concernés 

Si je vois que personnellement (et non par association car quelqu'un à dit une horreurs sans que je m'en dissocie) j'ai dit des choses aussi atroces je m'excuserai 

Jusqu'ici je me rappelle avoir quelques fois souhaité que d'autres se tannent comme moi de la redondance des accusations d'être des moutons ou de participer à la folie et à l'exploitation meurtrière et même d'en être complice 

Ce ne sont pas de minces accusations si c'est à cette période que vous faites allusion

Je suis surpris par ben des commentaires 

Imaginez    Nous avons Internet à une époque où la science médicale n'est pas aussi évolué aujourd'hui  Prenons une époque par exemple où la peste faisait rage et qu'un nouveau médicament qui peut l'enrayer se fait connaître    Je n'ai pas de difficulté à voir des commentaires du type j'en veux où peut on avoir un médicament contre ça!?

Aujourd'hui nous sommes plutôt en bonne santé  Vous n'avez pas plein de personnes mortes de la peste autour de vous    Il vaut mieux prévenir que guérir et je fais confiance à nos médecins de l'OMS et du Canada surtout en prenant en considération la quantité phénoménale d'information qu'ils doivent ingurgiter lors de leurs études pour en arriver là où ils sont  Je me dis qu'ils doivent savoir de quoi ils parlent nos médecins  Certainement plus que ceux qui n'ont pas étudié en médecine et qui s'acharnent sur les profils faramineux des compagnies pharmaceutiques en affirmant que tout est propagande pour faire de l'argent (par exemple)

Voulez-vous savoir a quel point les pharmaceutiques ont du poids dans les decision?

Le Vioxx a tue plusieurs patients par arret cardique  Sante Canada l'a retire du marche en 2004  Meme pas 1 an plutard Sante Canada a decide de le remettre en vente avec une etiquette mentionant que ce medicament peut te causer un arret cardiaque 

Pour moi c'est la meme chose que vendre un paquet de cigarette sur lequel on montionne peut causer infractus cancer     avec une photo qui fait peur  On devrait mettre une photo d'un coeur ayant subit une infractus sur les boites du Vioxx 


La Notice explicative du vaccin produit par NOVARTIS contre la grippe porcine H1N1 publiée sur internet admet qu’il provoque entre autres : Syndrome de Guillain–Barré vascularite paralysies choc anaphylactique et mort

Merci Spaceknife !!!!

Finalement le chat est sorti du sac 

Ceci est un bel exemple de la campagne de peur pour que les gens s'affolent et aillent se faire vacciner 

Il me semble que ce n'est pas la première fois que le Dr Poirier parle à travers son chapeau     il y a eu aussi le cas de la dame de 86 ans 

Ça sent de plus en plus mauvais cette campagne de vaccination !

Zorro18 à écrit:

c'est d'ailleurs pour cela qu'un certificat spéciale de vaccination vous est remis

La question que je me pose   Est-ce que c'est vrai qu'on est en train de remettre un certificat au vaccinés présentement? Est-ce qu'il y a quelqu'un qui s'est fait vacciné ou qui travail dans la vaccination et sais si les gens qui se font vacciné sont en train de recevoir un certificat spéciale?

Si tel est le cas ca devient préocupent pour la vaccination obligatoire    Qui pourrait être déclaré lorsque tous les volontaires se seront fait vacciner

Humm    rimafr de quel Orient tu parles? L'Orient des Francs maçons? Si oui peut-être as-tu raison sinon   je crois bien que ce qui suit concerne l'Orient?
- Le ministère iranien de la Santé a annoncé mercredi que la pandemié de grippe A/H1N1 a déjà fait 22 victimes dans le pays qui a enregistré 1638 cas confirmés à ce jour  - Le ministère irakien de la Santé a annoncé mercredi avoir enregistré 96 cas du virus A/H1N1 dont 67 cas découverts chez des soldats américains stationnés dans le pays  - le 30 octobre 2009 à 08h53 La phobie de la grippe H1N1 s'empare des écoles au Liban  Le ministère de la Santé évalue à 1500 le nombre de personnes touchées par la grippe H1N1 dans l'ensemble du Liban  Un premier cas mortel celui d'une femme enceinte de 30 ans a été annoncé en début de semaine 
- LE 31/10/2009 À 07:47 | © 2009 XINHUA / CHINE- Deux personnes ont succombé à la grippe A/H1N1 dans la partie continentale de Chine en 48 heures jusqu'à 15H00 vendredi portant le bilan des morts de la maladie à six a annoncé le ministère de la Santé dans un communiqué publié sur son site web vendredi soir  Et j'en passe    leurs médias sont aussi fou que les nôtres faut croire

Spaceknife la doc Laberge l'avait dit au début qu'elle et pas mal tous les médecins voyaient une méningite avec les symptômes que le jeune a eu avant de mourir 

Mais n'inquiétez-vous pas même SI les médias en parlent ils vont revenir sur ce jeune-en-santé-qui-est-mort-de-la-grippe au cours des prochaines semaines quand même  C'est le poster boy de leur campagne pour nous faire avaler les millions $ mis dans ce vaccin toxique

Selon moi les médias ont créé un faux débat  Plutôt que de parler des 50% de la population qui ne veulent pas se faire vacciner on parle de pénurie de vaccins    ce qui détourne l'attention vers quelque chose de 100 fois moins important : l'organisation de la campagne 

Est-ce moi qui est fou ou bien est-ce que les médias viennent de décider d'ignorer 50% de la population qui évoquait des craintes envers la sécurité du vaccin? Nous n'existons plus tout d'un coup!

On nous parle maintenant de pénurie et de problèmes d'organisation et on semble sous-entendre que tout le monde veut se faire vacciner  On ne parle pas non plus du fait qu'en France par exemple seulement 17% de la population compte se faire vacciner malgré la campagne de propagande menée par leurs médias  Même chose en allemagne  On ne dit pas qu'en Suisse on vient de prendre la décision de ne pas administrer le vaccin sur les femmes enceites et les enfants 

C'est tellement évident que tout est monté de toute pièce  Ça fait depuis mai dernier que je suis religieusement tous les développements autour de cette fausse pandémie  Je vous jure que c'est la première fois de ma vie que je vois quelque chose d'aussi ridicule se dérouler sous mes yeux  Le niveau de manipulation et de propagande a atteint un nouveau sommet et je dois souvent me pincer pour me prouver que je ne rêve pas  Voilà que maintenant tout le monde qui éternue est diagnostiqué avec la H1N1    pour gonfler les chiffres et faire monter la panique 

Je n'en dirai pas plus parce que je sais pertinemment que je me ferai traiter de conspirationniste  Je vais me contenter de dire qu'il y a des choses très louches et très inquiétantes qui se passent et il est important plus que jamais de penser par soi-même et ne pas embarquer dans la campagne de manipulation à notre égart

Pour un certificat de garantie- Copier/Coller
http://cozop com/internaute_choix_realite_org/certificat_de_garantie_vaccin_h1n1
Devant la menace de pandémie aviaire H1N1 les autorités sanitaires recommandent la vaccination pour tous  Avant d’accepter cette vaccination je souhaite dans le respect de la législation en vigueur recevoir du corps médical une information claire transparente et appropriée ainsi que l’assurance que le dit vaccin est sans danger conformément { l’obligation de prudence rappelée par la directive communautaire du droit de la consommation du 25 juillet 1985 qui « dispose qu’un produit est défectueux lorsqu’il n’offre pas la sécurité { laquelle on peut légitimement s’attendre  » 

J’entends donc recevoir l’assurance par le médecin que :

- la vaccination ne pourra en aucun cas activer des fonctions effectrices inappropriées

- ce vaccin est totalement dépourvu d’ADN contaminant hétérogène

- ce vaccin ne pourra entraîner ni altérations chromosomiques ni mutations ni retour du virus à la virulence

- qu’aucun variant des virus vaccinaux { action pathogène ne pourra se produire par le phénomène de complémentation ou de recombinaison

- que cette stimulation antigénique n’entraînera pas de perturbation de mon système immunitaire notamment une modification transitoire ou prolongée du rapport T4/T8 comme cela a déjà été observé (cf  M  Eihl J  Mannhalter G  Zlabinger New England Journal of Medecine vol 310 de 1984)

- que la vaccination n’exercera aucune action pathogène sur l’équilibre endocrinien (notamment la survenue de diabète comme c’est le cas avec le vaccin anti-hépatite B cf Pr  Barthelow Classen New Zealand Medical Journal 24 mai 1996) et le statut humoral

- que l’éventuelle persistance virale ne pourra être la cause d’aucune maladie auto-immune ni d’aucune altération du système nerveux central

- qu’aucune réaction allergique aux divers adjuvants des vaccins ne pourra se produire

__- que je ne risque pas de présenter une myofasciite à macrophages laquelle peut apparaître dans un délai de quelques semaines { plus de trente ans après toute vaccination faisant appel { l’hydroxyde d’aluminium (cf  Gherardi et all  “Macrophagic myofasciitis : a reaction to intramuscular injections of aluminium containing vaccines” in Journal of Neurology n° 246 1999)  Il en est de même pour le MF 59 utilisé par le laboratoire Novartis__(suite prochain mail)

-suite certificat-
-que je ne présenterai aucun risque de développer ultérieurement une maladie d’Alzheimer ou un cancer au point d’injection de vaccins en rapport avec cet hydroxyde d’aluminium lequel est responsable chez les animaux domestiques d’une véritable flambée de cancers : Selon une étude réalisée entre 1982 et 1993 dans 258 cliniques américaines le nombre de cancers chez les animaux de compagnie a en effet été multiplié par 11  Cette évolution est d’autant plus inquiétante que le nombre de sarcomes cutanés au point d’injection vaccinale faisant appel { l’hydroxyde d’aluminium a été multiplié par 184 tandis que celui des sarcomes en dehors des points d’injection n’a été multiplié que par 57  (Cf  Lester S & al  Journal of the american animal hospital association 1996) 

Dès que j’aurai obtenu toutes les réponses écrites de la part du médecin { mes interrogations légitimes je serai suffisamment informé(e) pour vous apporter mon consentement ou mon refus éclairés conformément à la dernière loi sur les droits des malades (loi 2002-303 du 4 mars 2002 publiée au Journal Officiel du 5 mars sur le consentement libre et éclairé)

Bon samedi mauvaise nouvelle 
Première leçon de cruauté d'une petite fille de 11 ans 
La petite fille de 11 ans d'une collègue vient de recevoir sa première expérience majeure de rejet et d'intimidation globale de sa petite vie  Vendredi les professeurs de son école donnaient une séance d'information sur la nécessité de prendre le vaccin contre le possiblement mortel virus de H1N1  Après la session elle a exprimé en toute innocence et pleine de confiance que sa maman et elle même ne prendrait pas le vaccin car il n'était pas assez sécuritaire et qu'ils préféraient prendre des vitamines C D du Chlorure de magnésium bien manger etc  etc  Well! En coeur les élèves l'ont attaquée et invectivée lui ont dit que si quelqu'un l'attrapait à l'école ce serait sa faute que sa mère était une meurtrière qu'on pouvait en mourir    que    etc  Ce fut horrible ils ne l'ont pas lâchée de toute la journée elle a vu sa meilleure amie partir du coté des ennemis et même qu'elle s'est fait bousculée par les bullies en puissance à la récré  La prof  n'est presque pas intervenue sauf durant la récré quand les garçons ont commencé à être trop physique    La petite est arrivée à la maison le coeur brisé et totalement confuse  Nous parlons de la commission scolaire de Montréal    la changer d'école n'y changerait rien  Elle craint et sens très bien maintenant le jour ou la vaccination sera obligatoire 
Je lisais aujourd'hui que le magazine Macleans faisait le procès de Montréal disant qu'elle était une ville corrompue à tous les niveaux tant fédéral provincial que municipal totalement controlée par la mafia    Quand verra t-on un article choc signé du journaliste d'un magazine ou journal soit dit respectable ou d'état faire le procès de ce qui est en train de ce tramé par la pharmaceutique? Ceci ira trop loin beaucoup trop loin  Ils ne sont plus capable d'esprit critique  Pourquoi osent-on attaquer la mafia    mais pas la pharmaceutique???

Ni aucun article sur Tom Jefferson l'épidémiologiste qui se prononce nettement contre cette campagne de peur

PARTIE I / II

La communaute scientifique n'est pas convaincu que la grippe H1N1 est la priorite des virus a combattre  Cette sorte de virus infuenza n'est pas dangereux  Ils disent que les medecins ont ete mal informes 

Ce qu'il faut retenir avant de lire la suite:

0- Si ce virus etait dangeureux on aurait declare l'etat d'urgence mettre des gens en quarantaine bloquer des frontieres  ON AURAIT SUTROUT PAS ENCOURAGER LES GENS A ALLER L'ALLOWEEN!!!
1- L'influenza ne represente que 7% des deces causes par virus
2- L'OMS vient de changer la definition de ce c'est une Pandemie
3- Le H1N1 a un taux de mortalite inferieur a la grippe saisonniere
4- Les gens atteints du H1N1 meurent d'un facteur secondaire dont probalement une infection baterienne 
5- La grippe Espagnole a ete causee par le H1N1  Cependant les scientifiques ne sont pas certains des causes de deces car on ne savait pas soigner une simple infection bacterienne a l'epoque  Aussi c'etait la guerre les moyens manquaient et les gens etaient mal nourris mal chauffes    
6- Le vaccin est deconseille par le prix Nobel de medecine de 2006 
7- L'hivers vient de se terminer en Australie  Le H1N1 a tue moins de gens qu'une simple grippe saisonniere 
8- En Aout/2009 le Canada a assure les pharmaceutique qu'il n'y aura pas de poursuites en cas de pepins  Les USAs l'ont fait depuis 2001 
9- Le gouvernement Tcheque a refuse le vaccin conte le H1N1  A vous de chercher les raison
10- 4 deces suite a la vaccination contre le H1N1 en Suede? (a confirmer)


BONNE LECTURE POUR LA SUITE    


Selon des etudes publiees recemment par Tom Jefferson l'influza ne represente que 7% des deces causes par virus  Il dit que c'est de l'argent facile qui est gagne par les pharmaceutiques  Tom Jefferson est un expert en epidimilogies reconnu mondialement  Sante Canada par exemple fait pleins de reference a ces publications 

Aussi le prix Nobel de Médecine et Physiologie 2006 pense qu'on ne doit pas vacciner contre la grippe:
http://www mondialisation ca/index php?context=va&aid=3995

La grippe saisonniere normale cause un taux de mortalite de 1/1000 a 2000 personnes parmis les personnes infectees  La H1N1 a tue a son maximum 1/14000

PARTIE II / II

Les scientifiques pensent que les personnes declaree decedees suite a une contamination au H1N1 sont plutot mortes du a un facteur secondaire dont possiblement une infection bacterienne dans bien des cas  Ils disent qu'a l'epoque de la grippe Espagnole les gens etaient mal nourris et pouvaient mourrir d'une simple infection bacterienne  La Pelicilines n'etait pas encore inventee  Dans certains cas le H1N1 peut affaiblir considerablement les defenses d'une personnes  Malheureusement il n'y a pas eu d'etudes qui verifient s'il y a eu lieu infection bacterienne pour cas declare decedes suite au H1N1 

Voici une entrevue avec Tom Jefferson ou il condamne notament le fait qu'on vient de changer la definition meme de ce c'est une pandemie au niveau de l'OMS (Organisation Mondiale de la Sante):
http://medicalconsumers org/2009/09/24/why-the-h1n1-virus-is-not-a-major-threat/

Le Dr  Marc Lipsitch (Harvard University) a agit en tant que consultant pour aider le gouvernement des USA a evaluer les dangers du H1N1  Il est entierement en desaccord avec ceux qui decident  Selon lui c'est une pandemie niveau 1 au lieux de 5

Je sais pas si vous avez reçu le guide autosoins de grippe A H1N1 et que vous l'avez lu mais à la page 3 dans le rectangle tout en bas de la page il est écrit :

     Si vous contractez la maladie les anticorps que vous aurez développés durant celle-ci vous protégeront par la suite contre le virus 

Donc tous les médecins qui disent que l'on doit tout de même se faire vacciner même si nous avons contracté auparavant le virus est FAUX !!!

En temps normaux je serais d’accord avec votre raisonnement mais n’oublier pas que comme vous le soulignez vous pouvez fermer les portes de votre restaurant à 22 hre  Le virus n’a pas d’heure les urgences non plus  Nous ne sommes pas en temps normaux l’évolution des évenements ce passe en temps réelles la transmission d’information aussi avec les résultats que l’on a en ce moment  Dans votre restaurant vous gérez sensiblement continuellement la même chose au quotidien vous savez très bien que la situation est différente au niveau de l’état vous auriez sans doute raison en parlant des parlementaire mais ce n’est pas de cela qu’il s’agit ici 
Je vous cite :
‘’Ceci dit avec toute la campagne pré-vaccination annonçant quasiment la fin du monde (mais avec un remède miracle) et les contradictions qui découlent de leur inéfficacité    cela ressemble beaucoup plus au jeu diviser pour mieux régner’’
Voulez-vous insinuer qu’ils font semblant d’être inefficace dans le but de mieux diviser? Serait-ce vraiment une bonne stratégie?
Je vous cite encore :
‘’ Ce qui me fait douter de la véracité de toute cette histoire’’
Insinuez-vous qu’il n’y a pas de virus en circulation?
En passant vous mélangez carence nutritionnel et infection virale (le scorbut est causé par une carence en vitamine C d’où le nom de cette vitamine : acide ascorbique)  Malgré la meilleure nutrition du monde une infection reste une infection  Je suis d’accord avec vous si vous avez des carences spécifiques votre système immunitaire peut s’en retrouvé affaiblit  Par contre si vous n’avez aucune carence votre système restera ce qu’il est alerte et sans plus  Il ne peut pas être ‘’booster’’ comme ce que certain commerçants tentent de nous faire croire en ce moment 

Je pense que vous ne comprenez pas le but de la vaccination

Vous écrivez

Toutefois ça n'exclut pas qu'il peut venir tout juste d'apparaître

J'imagine que vous faites allusion au fait que tous les virus mutent continuellement pour s'adapter à leur environnement et de ce fait peuvent être considérés comme nouveaux une fois qu'ils reviennent nous emmerder  

Mais il me semble que la tendance naturelle des mutations serait de favoriser leur prolifération en diminuant leur dangerosité et c'est ce qui semble se passer avec ce H1N1 qui est passablement inoffensif si on compare les statistiques avec la grippe saisonnière 

Par grippe saisonnière je sais bien qu'il n'y a pas qu'un virus d'impliqué mais quand même il n'y a vraiment rien pour fouetter un chat avec le très faible nombre de victimes de ce H1N1

Cet article du Der Spiegel d'un immunologisteTom Jefferson est quand même assez convaincant 
http://www spiegel de/international/world/0151863711900 html

Je présume que vous êtes un chercheur car il y a beaucoup de recherche à Novato alors si c'est le cas vous savez aussi très bien que notre connaissance des virus est très limitée et les certitudes sont molles sur ce sujet

Certains sicentifiques comme Jefferson croit que la situation du H1N1 est moins importante que la situation alarmiste proposé par les média semble le montré  Toutefois  il ne nie pas la situation ni ne nie l'efficacité des vaccins en général  Vous terminez en disant que ce que la communauté scientifique pensait était résumé dans le blog  Il ne faudrait pas mettre tous le monde dans le même bateau

Poirier a rétabli les faits hier mais il y a qq heures Radio Canada vient de publier cette nouvelle au cas ou vous ne l'auriez pas vue 
Il remettent ça avec le jeune homme 
http://www radio-canada ca/regions/Ontario/2009/10/31/001-Deces_fillette_H1N1 shtml

C'est le même Dr Poirier qui parlait du Gardasil comme un vaccin contre le cancer de l'utérus ce qui est un raccourci inacceptable pour un scientifique 

Mais nous avons eu cet échange déja non?

''Donc tous les médecins qui disent que l'on doit tout de même se faire vacciner même si nous avons contracté auparavant le virus est FAUX !!!''

je suis d'accord avec vous y a-til un médecin qui vous a dit cela?

Je ne suis pas contre tous les arguments de Jefferson  Par contre avec les faits en mains et certaines extrapolation de ce que l'on a déja vue je continue de croire que la vaccination s'avère recomandable  Ce qui m'embête un peu par contre c'est qu'il prend des racourcis pour passer son point 
Ex: il affirme qu'aucune étude ne montre l'efficacité de la campagne de vaccination saisonnière  Pourtant d’après les évaluations du centre de contrôle et de prévention des maladies aux Étas-Unis (CDC) chez une personne adulte et en santé la vaccination contre les virus de la grippe saisonnière mène à une réduction de 70-90% des chances d’attraper la grippe (saisonnière) http://www cdc gov/flu/about/qa/vaccineeffect htm 
Je n'est rien contre le fait d'être à contre courant d'ailleurs ça ne devrait pas être important du moins en science les faits sont les faits et on devrait bâtir la-dessus  Par contre dans ce cas-ci: soit il ignorait l'étude soit il a ignoré l'étude dans les deux cas ça lui enlève de la crédibilité en tant qu'expert

Je ne nie pas et n'ai jamais nié l'efficacité du vaccin pour le H1N1 ni de celui de la grippe saisonnière  Quoi que je garde certaines réserves 

SI j'étais dans un groupe à risque j'y songerais quoique       pas certain que je le prendrais pour le H1N1
Si j'étais un travailleur de la santé j'y songerais aussi mais certainement pas sous la contrainte comme ils le font présentement 

Je dénonce particulièrement la tentative de culpabilisation que la santé publique utilise dans sa propagande envers ceux qui refusent le vaccin et la très malhabile campagne de vaccination de masse que je trouve franchement exagérée et un peu suspecte ( c'est la que les théories de complot interviennent mais j'en tiens très peu compte dans mon jugement)

Je trouve que les vrais responsables de cette hystérie ce sont les dirigeants de l'OMS qui on sauté aux conclusions beaucoup trop vite avec ce ridicule niveau d'alerte au plus élevé qu'ils ont décrété et qui a provoqué tout ce merdier 

Je m'insurge aussi contre l'utilisation intempestive d'antiviraux très peu éprouvés et extrêmement payants pour les pharmas et je suis plus inquiet des dommages qu'ils peuvent faire et des mutations qu'ils peuvent engendrer sur les virus que du virus lui même tout comme les atb l'ont fait pour les bactéries 
Beaucoup de suspicion de ce coté aussi en ce qui me concerne 

Et la cerise sur le sundae les médias d'information qui n'ont définitivement pas été à la hauteur et je suis indulgent car c'est plutôt catastrophique 

Je n'ose imaginer ce qui se passerait si qq chose de vraiment grave arrivait  

La presse est un important rempart de la démocratie et on peut constater ce que ça donne quand ils ne font pas leur boulot 
L'invasion de l'Irak par exemple facilitée par la complaisance de la presse américaine

Dernière observation
En science il y a très peu de lois immuables mais beaucoup de théories qui sont valables jusqu'à ce qu'on en trouve une qui explique mieux un phénomène observé 

Et à la fin on se retrouve généralement avec de nouvelles questions plus que des réponses et c'est très bien comme ça 

C'est pourquoi la science est si passionnante et plus on apprend plus on réalise l'ampleur de notre ignorance

Je ne suis pas contre la vaccination   Mais pour ce H1N1 je doute toujours!

Toujours est-til que 60% de la population du canada à été assez senser pour ne pas ce faire vacciner innutillement 

À part les jeunes enfants  les personnes agées et les gens vulnérable aux maladies Ce vacin était totalement inutile compte tenu de la faible dangerosité du virus (beaucoup plus bas que la majorité des grippes) 

Il à été tout de même ammusant de voir Amir Khadir faire son show devant les caméras et prétendre que la situation était alarmante Meilleurs chance la prochain fois Amir

Ils ont eu peur que ce virus mute  Ok s'il mute est ce que le vaccin serait efficace 
NON  

Erreur  Tu aurais intérêt à te renseigner un peu plus sur la matière  Ce qui mute dans le virus c'est la machinerie interne qui détermine sa virulence et l'intensité de ses symptômes  Le vaccin lui stimule la produit d'anticorps qui visent à inhiber l'agglutinine présente sur la surface du virus ce qui fait que ce dernier ne peut se fixer aux cellules et ainsi l'infecter  Même si la machinerie interne mute les anticorps sont encore appropriés pour inhiber l'agglutinine sur le virus qui ne change pas 



Pour ceux qui scandent que ce vaccin était inutile: N'avez-vous jamais pensé que si la propagation du virus était limitée c'était à cause des mesures mises en place telles que le vaccin? En gros vous profitez du fait que les autres plus responsables se sont fait vacciner et ne vous ont ainsi rien transmis 

De plus la vaccination est loin d'être inutile  Elle permet d'éviter d'avoir à souffrir des symptômes grippaux et de perdre une semaine de travail inutilement  Est-ce qu'une petite piqure vaut la peine pour éviter une semaine de maladie? Oui définitivement

Le vaccin était pou prévenir l'imprévisible  Non il n'y a pas eu d'hécatombe   Tant mieux   Non?
Et si il y avait eu hécatombe? Et qu'on avait rien fait pour la prévenir même si elle était prévenable?
Comment faire pour prévoir si il y aura hécatombe? Si on le savait   
Par contre ce que l'on sait c'est que ce virus a déja mené dans une troisième vague a des dizaine de millions de morts  Il y aurait été irresponsable de ne pas vacciner point à la ligne 

Annihilator
je suis en accord avec presque tout votre dernier message  Sauf que il est faut de dire que des mutations ne peuvent pas rendre le virus invisible au système immunitaire  Lorsqu'il y a une mutation une protéine change un peu  Si c'est l'hémaglutinine il est possible que les anticorps ne reconnaisse plus le virus muté (ça ne veut pas dire que ça va arriver)  C'est la majeur raison pourquoi l'on doit vacciner à chaque année pour la grippe saisonière

Il est grand temps que ça finisse et que l'on cesse de gaspiller des ressources et du personnel pour cette campagne ridicule de vaccination massive pour un virus passablement inoffensif 

Le personnel médical est au bout du rouleau et les ressources manquent gravement alors passons rapidement à autre chose et occupons nous des gens vraiment malades dans les corridors des urgences 

Une chance que ce virus n'était pas dangereux car au départ le simple fait de rassembler des personnes à risque dans des endroits clos ou ils respirent l'air que les autres expirent et de les faire attendre pendant des heures pour les vacciner est le meilleur moyen de propager un virus comme celui de la grippe qui se transmet très bien par voie aérienne 

La grippe ne se transmet pas en donnant la main à son voisin ni sur les bols de toilette cela s'applique surtout aux bactéries 
N'importe quel étudiant en médecine de première année sait cela 
Les virus de grippe se transmettent principalement en respirant des gouttelettes contaminées qui flottent dans l'air et qui sont émises par la toux de personnes infectées 

La dérive sécuritaire  des autorités sanitaires ministre en tête m'inquiète beaucoup et en dit long sur ceux qui nous gouvernent et leur compétence 

Cette nouvelle tactique de propagande utilisée abondamment par les autorités sanitaires qui consiste à culpabiliser systématiquement quiconque décide de ne pas se faire vacciner est aussi très inquiétante et dangereuse à mon avis 

Sans oublier les menaces au personnel et aux médecins qui avaient des doutes sur l'opportunité de cette campagne 

En terminant la presse qui est supposée être un rempart de la démocratie a montré de grandes faiblesses dans ce dossier en se faisant plus un organe de propagande des autorités que du vrai travail journalistique de recherche mise en perspective et comparaisons aux années précédentes 

Ensuite messieurs dames journalistes vous vous demanderez pourquoi de plus en plus les gens délaissent les médias traditionnels

Vos opinions sont généralement sensées et bien documentées mais là vous tombez dans la propagande 

SI on voulait prévenir tous les imprévisibles qui risquent de nous affecter gravement ça couterait très cher et ça relèverait de l'impossible alors on procède par priorité 

Cette prétendue pandémie était totalement enflée a donné lieu à une campagne de propagande comme j'ai rarement vu et pendant ce temps des problèmes infiniment plus sérieux et couteux en vies affectent notre système de santé sans compter le personnel qui est au bout du rouleau 

Il n'y en aura pas de troisième vague comme celle que vous décrivez qui a fait des millions de victimes car la réalité d'aujourd'hui est toute autre et la mixité des populations et la rapidité des voyages fait en sorte que nous sommes mieux immunisés naturellement que les gens l'étaient à cette époque

Mon infirmière de femme donne actuellement le vaccin en CLSC pour les personnes en première ligne je vais pour ma part travailler au stade olympique pour la campagne de vaccination  (j'ai été embauché pour de l'administratif)
Ce qui ressort des premières journées pour ma femme c'est le GRAND amateurisme dans lequel cette campagne est menée !
Par exemple vendredi les policiers étaient vaccinés ce n'était plus le cas hier ils sont passés de première ligne à rien et pourquoi ???

Les travailleurs en CPE ne sont pas des premières lignes ah bon ? et si l'enfant d'une infirmière est malade vous croyez vraiment qu'elle va aller vacciner plus tôt que de s'occuper de son enfant ? ou si cette employée est malade elle ne pourra pas travailler combien de parents seront alors touchés ?

Toujours hier entre 8h et 16h il n'y a eu que 91 personnes de vaccinés !!!!! pourquoi ne pas ouvrir les portes un peu plus lorsqu'il n'y a personne à vacciner plus tôt qu'aux premières lignes dont finalement personne ne sait qui est concerné 

On nous parle depuis des mois du h1n1 et finalement les seuls choses parfaitement claires sont les contrat avec les pharmaceutiques parce que le reste niveau efficacité organisation bon sens c'est le néant totale !!

Mais ne vous en faite pas il y a du fric à faire postulez et vous serez embauchés pour 6 semaines et c'est bien mieux payé qu'au loblaws

Bonjour

Je suis maman d'un premier bébé âgé seulement de 2 mois et ce matin je viens d'apprendre que mon CLSC arrêtait de faire le suivi des bébés parce que les infirmières doivent être disponible pour la vaccination imminante contre la grippe A(H1N1) !

Franchement sans vous donner toute mon opinion à propos de cette grosse campagne de peur je me pose la question suivante 

Sommes nous à ce point aveuglé pour ne pas constater que la société préfère mettre un baume sur son incapacité ou son manque de volonté à s'alimenter correctement et à maintenir son système immunitaire fort que de soutenir la croissance de sa très jeune population ?

Les décideurs préfèrent-ils maintenir la population dans la peur et dans l'utopie d'une existence sans maladie au détriment du développement de son avenir ?

Parce que nous vivons dans une société qui doit toujours être de plus en plus productive aseptisée et si elle est malade qui doit toujours pouvoir continuer continuer continuer     comme le lapin energizer !!!

Personnellement je connais des gens qui ont eu cette fameuse grippe et personne n'est mort  Il est vrai que pour ceux dont le système immunitaire est faible le risque est plus grand  Suis-je donc si vieux jeu de croire qu'il vaut mieux prévenir que guérir: soyez actif alimentez-vous correctement prenez des probiotiques et acceptez d'être malade un jour ou deux

Tu peux toujours dire que ce médecin dit des foutaises

Concernant le taux de mercure    Tu dis que c'est de la foutaise que que le vaccin n'est pas trop différents des autres vaccins de la grippe des autres années    C'est bizzare car cette année on utilise un nouvel adjuvant qui n'a jamais été utilisé au Canada  Et si ce nouvel adjuvant serait si sécuritaire pourquoi que le gouvernement retarde la distribution de vaccin à la population normale pour en faire un sans adjuvants pour les femmes enceinte?

Dans le cas du vaccin contre la grippe A (H1N1) l'adjuvant est composé d'huile naturelle d'eau et de vitamine E  S'il vous plaît renseignez vous sérieusement au lieu de prêter attention aux théories de conspiration en vogue sur le net!

Le gouvernement retarde le vaccin parce qu'il a mal planifié la distribution du vaccin  Pourquoi faire appel aux explications impliquant des théories de conspiration quand la simple incompétence suffit à tout expliquer?

Et Fox News est un repaire de l'extrême droite américaine qui propage souvent des mensonges et de la propagande  Selon un bon nombre de personnes travaillant pour Fox News Obama n'est pas né aux États Unis et il est un socialiste musulman 

Dans d'autres mots leur crédibilité est nulle

Ce n'est pas une campagne de peur :
Le virus s'attaque aux personnes en mauvaise santé MAIS tout aussi aux jeunes de moins de 25 ans en santé et pour eux la maladie progresse très rapidement  pensez au jeune hockeyeur ontarien qui est mort en 2 jours  
Au Québec  il y a eu 2768 cas entre mai et septembre et 28 morts soit 1 % des cas  
Ce n'est pas une grippe ordinaire et il est très réductif voire irresponsable de penser que la vaccination massive est un complot des cies pharmaceutiques et des élus  
Ceux qui refusent le vaccin jouent avec le feu et risquent de brûler leurs proches  
Finalement la piqure ne fait pas mal !

Mon commentaire est au sujet de l'ordre de vaccination 
Je suis d'accord avec leur idée de donner priorité à certains groupes de personnes considérées à risque mais je pense que TOUS les proches de ces personnes devraient aussi l'être!
Je donne mon exemple: Je suis père de famille et j'ai 37 ans  Ma conjointe est enceinte de 23 semaines et j'ai une petite fille de 8 mois à la maison     donc ma conjointe et ma fille peuvent être vaccinées et pas moi     je trouves cela ridicule!
Si j'attrape la grippe je serai un danger pour eux!! En plus je devrai aller me mettre en file une 2 ieme fois et courir la chance d'être exposé à d'éventuelles personnes contaminées dans la file d'attente dans un mois!     Non    c'est tellement ridicule que l'on va attendre que je puisse l'être et on va tous se faire vacciner en même temps si on décide d'y aller! Et je suis d'accord avec Domita une bonne alimentation du repos et un bonne hygiène de vie est bien mieux que le vaccin!
Et ils ne devraient pas négliger le suivi des bébés pour cela!!

vous croyez vraiment que ­­BIEN MANGER DU REPOS ET UNE BONNE HYGIÈNE DE VIE EST MIEUX QUE LE VACCIN ?
Pour moi c'est de la pensée magique : avez vous déjà été malade ? si oui un microbe ou un virus qui passait par là a bafoué votre crédulité en vous rendant malade  
Et ne me dites pas que votre mode de vie fait que vous n'êtes jamais malade

Plus de sept heures d'attente aujourd'hui avec un enfant de 18 mois dont cinq à l'extérieur afin d'obtenir ce vaccin  J'ai bien hâte de voir le résultat lorsque la masse se présentera  Nous devrons répéter l'expérience dans deux semaines alors que ce sera au tour de nos deux autres enfants plus agés  Finalement un autre sept heures pour nous-même dans environ un mois  À huit infirmières pour des milliers de personnes pas étonnant que ce soit si long et des heures d'ouvertures plutôt discutable soit de 12h00 à 20h00 ?

Est-ce nos décideurs prennent en compte les pertes de productivité et les pertes économiques qui sont associées qui en découlent ? Pourquoi le personnel affecté à la vaccination ne se rend-il pas dans les écoles directement comme cela se fait aux États-Unis ? Au moins nous pourrions éviter de perdre une journée de travail

Nous faisons face à une pseudo-pandémie alimentée par la peur 
Les chiffres avancés par l'OMS sont falsifiés car ils tiennent compte de tous les cas de grippe et pneumonies confondues comme étant des cas de grippe A (H1N1) 
Donc dans leurs calculs la bonne vieille grippe saisonnière la H3N2 est incluse dans le compte    ainsi que tous les cas reliés aux problèmes respiratoires et pulmonaires 

Les vraies raisons de cette folie furieuse qui a cours    nous commençons à peine à les entrevoir et lorsqu'elles nous éclateront en pleine face il sera trop tard pour faire marche arrière !

Avec deux accouchements avec une sage femme mes enfants n'ont jamais été vaccinés que ça soit la cinquantaine de vaccins à la naissance ou bien les vaccins de plus à l'adolescence ils ne sont pas plus malades que les autres même que la seule maladie qu'ils ont attrapé en 15 ans est la varicelle jamais de grippes de sinusites    mais un petit rhume parfois oui ça arrive

Encore une fois un titre pour inquiéter la population  Qui a-t-il de si urgent dans cette cession parlementaire???

Si c'est pour permettre à l'opposition de critiquer la gestion des Conservateurs je crois que ça aurait pu attendre à demain dans le cadre d'une cession normale de notre parlement  C'est pas comme si les conservateurs allaient reconnaitre leurs erreurs ce soir et commander plus de vaccins au milieu de la nuit!

Franchement! Calmez-vous le pompon! On ne fabrique pas les vaccins comme on fabrique des cachets d'aspirine ça prends du temps  Et parfois il faut évaluer les délais imputable à un mauvais plan d'action versus tenter de tout changer et risquer de créer une plus grande confusion et de nouveaux retard

Si vous n'avez pas vacciné vos enfants et qu'il ne sont pas tombées malades c'est parce que vous avez été chanceux et parce que vous avez profité du fait que la vaste majorité des parents vaccinent leurs enfants ce qui diminue grandement l'incidence d'un grand nombre de maladies infectieuses  Dans d'autres mots vous profitez des efforts des autres 

Pendant la plus grande partie de l'histoire humaine les populations étaient entièrement à la merci des maladies infectieuses  Des millions de personnes (j'exagère pas) ont été tuées par des fléaux que maintenant du moins en occident sont devenus presque entièrement disparus  Et maintenant qu'on a des moyens de garder un ces maladies sous contrôle des tatas obscurantistes et ignorants de l'histoire ne veulent rien savoir de la vaccination se croyant à l'abri sans se rendre compte que leur sécurité est due aux efforts des autres! C'est désolant!

Bien sur si jamais des maladies qu'on croyait disparues en occident comme la polio la rubéole et la coqueluche des maladies maintenant si rares que les tatas obscurantistes anti-vaccination ne savent même plus ce que c'est reviennent en force devinez qui va se précipiter les premiers à grands cris faire vacciner leurs poupons?

je travaille dans le système de la santé depuis 11 ans cette pandémie est géré de la même façon à l'externe qu'à l'interne je m'explique vendredi quand je suis parti du travail il y avait un cas de H1N1 déclaré officiellement après ma fin de semaine ce matin on m'annonce qu'il y 10 cas déclarés officiellement dont 3 hier qui ont nécessité un renvoi aux soins intensifs c'est a dire un changement de pavillon et bien deviné quoi la vaccination aujourd'hui était dans le même pavillon que les gens atteint et qui ont été transféré hier donc en plus de se faire vacciné les gens qui sont entrés dans le pavillon aujourd'hui risque de contracter le virus avant que le vaccin soir pleinement efficace en plus il y a des cas de C difficile dans ce même pavillon vive la bonne gestion

Ne perdez pas votre temps à essayer de faire comprendre le bon sens à tous ces amateurs de conspirations 

Je vous cite le passage d'un livre de psycho qui m'a fait comprendre bien des choses sur ces personnes :

    En se regroupant les marginaux s'ennoblissent se croient supérieurs et uniques  Les sectes offrent un exemple éloquent de ce phénomène  Les membres d'une secte se croient détenteurs d'un secret qu'ils sont les seuls à posséder et qui les élève au-dessus du reste du monde  Ce sont eux maintenant qui sont intégrés et le reste du monde qui se compose de marginaux 

Quand j'ai lu ça ça m'a tout de suite sauté au visage 

Quand on les compare aux membres d'une secte l'attitude des conspirationistes prend tout son sens

Je voudrais dénoncer une petite nouvelle annoncée par Patrice Roy au téléjournal du 2 novembre vers 6:30pm  Il a dit que le jeune adolescent Ontarien qui est décédé de la grippe h1n1 a eu son service funéraire  On s'en doutait qu'il aurait droit a un service funéraire  Quel est l'intérêt public de dire et de montrer des impages de ce fait divers sinon de nourrir l'anxiété d'une bonne partie du public 
Pourquoi pas parler des dizaines d'autres vicitimes de la grippe? Quand l'événement est arrivé le traitement donné a ce fait divers a été incroyable  Pendant environ 36 heures presque tous les bulletins de nouvelles ont répété et montré les images du jeune hockeyeur et du père affligé  On aurait dit une campagne de lavage de cerveau  Pas étonnant qu'après çà les gens se bousculaient à St-Eustache pour se faire vacciner  Les media ne peuvent pas s'empêcher du faire du sensationnalisme faut bien faire augmenter les cotes d'écoute    Tant pis pour les nuances

Voici un petit commentaire à haute saveur conspirationiste  Désoler si cela en fâche quelques un 

Une suposé fuite d'un document cofidentiel chez IBM datant de 2006 concernant les procédures de préparations de cette pandémie 

http://preventdisease com/news/09/110209_ibm_internal_doc_reveals_knowledge_pandemic_2006 shtml

Voici les points les plus pertitants:

-Il y a 100% de chance qu'une pandémie va arriver au cours de 5 prochaines années 
-Durant la pandémie un maximum de 30% de la force de travail sera disponible 
-Il va y avoir 2 vagues de la pandémie chaqune va durer 12 semaines séparé par une pause de 12 semaines 

C'est peut-être un canulard mais les informations sur la pandémie sont tellement précises    une première vague de 12 semaine une pause de 12 semaine et une deuxième vague de 12 semaine  De plus le document dans son ensemble à l'air très crédible 

Si cette première vague qui vient de commencer se déroule jusqu'à fin janvier et qu'une deuxième vague de déroule de mai à juillet 2010 on aura peut-être des gros indices qui porte à croire que cette pandémie est un complot

Je ne prétends pas qu'une bonne hygiène de vie repos et bonne alimentation m'empêcheront d'être malade mais ce que je voulais dire c'est qu'une fois malade la guérison seras plus facile (dans la norme des choses) Je ne suis pas contre le vaccin je pense seulement que l'ordre de priorité actuel fait en sorte qu'il y'a beaucoup de perte de temps  Une même famille peut se composer de plusieurs groupes différents comme par exemple: bébé femme enceinte adulte en santé enfant en bas âge enfant 5 ans et + etc  Mais je comprends aussi que due au manque de doses ce n'est pas facile  Et on ne peut pas nier que les médias n'aident en rien la peur suscitée par cette grippe  C'est juste une grippe!

Notes d'un gars qui en sait long sur les brevets   
La demande de brevet du vaccin a été enregistrée longtemps avant que la grippe porcine mexicaine supposée est apparue comme nouvelle souche d’un virus provenant d’une « ferme porcine » au Mexique  Il s’agit du 28 août 2007 soit un an avant son adoption ! Certains disent que c'est 2008    en fait 2008 c'est l'acceptation finale l'enregistrement du brevet    C’est un coup encore plus fumant que ce que vous pensiez …

Voici le lien vers le bureau des Brevets des Etats Unis pour voir le brevet : http://appft uspto gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=/netahtml/PTO/search-bool html&r=3&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PG01&s1=Kistner IN &OS=IN/Kistner&RS=IN/Kistner

Et oui le virus de la grippe porcine HIN1 est listé « parmi de nombreux autres » dont extrait de la Demande de Brevet : [0056] « Un vaccin peut être utilisé entre autres comme injection prophylactique contre une maladie liée à un virus  Parmi les intégrations particulièrement préférées la composition ou vaccin comprend plus d’un antigène p  ex  2 3 4 5 6 7 ou 8 en particulier de différentes souches de virus sous-types ou types tels que la grippe A et la grippe B sélectionnés en particulier à partir d’un ou plus des sous-types humains de H1NI1 H2N2 H3N2 H7N7 H1N2 H9N2 H7N2 H7N3 H10N7 des sous-types de la grippe porcine H1N1 H1N2 H3N1 et H3N2 des sous-types de la grippe canine ou équine H7N7 H3N8 ou des sous-types aviaires H5N1 H7N2 H1N7 H7N3 H13N6 H5N9 H11N6 H3N8 H9N2 H5N2 H4N8 H10N7 H2N2 H8N4 H14N5 H6N5 H12N5  »

Quand la page s’ouvre cliquez sur l’onglet « Image File Wrapper » puis sélectionnez « Specification » et allez à la page 13 des spécifications  Là vous verrez les références virales des virus telles que notées ci-dessus et la date qui correspond est le « 28/08/07 » longtemps avant que le virus n’ait été promu « nouvelle souche mortelle » apparu dans une ferme porcine au Mexique

Je suis entièrement d'accord avec vous quel est vraiment le but recherché en montrant les funérailles du jeune garçon et même si c'était vrai qu'il soit mort de la grippe ?
Pourqoui ???
Une seule raison entretenir la peur et garder la psychose bien vivante déjà bien visible chez la population surtout les parents avec des jeunes enfants ainsi les gens vont continuer d'aller faire faire la file au froid et au vent et même sous la pluie ce qui n'est pas trop grave pour des gens en bonne santé mais pour des enfants dans les bras de leur parent (un seul parent peut se faire vacciner) et les personnes à risque oui ils sont bien à risque de pogner un bon gros rhume ou d'attrapper la grippe directement sur les lieux où des gens probablement contaminés se trouveront parmi les autres pour se faire vacciner !
Quand ma mère est décédée de la grippe en 2000 elle n'a pas passé à la télé cela n'était d'aucun intérêt même si cette année là il y a eu plusieurs décès dans la région   de personnes vaccinées en plus !

Ils sont en train de faire muter le virus dans le laboratoire P4 à Lyon afin de le rendre plus virulent 

Lyon Mag com : Quels types de recherches sont menés au sein du laboratoire contre le virus de la Grippe A ?

Bruno Lina : On essaye d’imaginer l’évolution de ce virus  Et parmi les scénario qui sont possibles il y a le facteur de virulence  Les travaux que l’on mène donc aujourd’hui dans le P4 concernent le virus H1N 1 et dans lequel on introduit un gène de virulence pour voir si celui-ci l’accepte et s’il devient du même coup plus dangereux  Pour l’instant le virus a beaucoup de mal à acquérir le facteur de virulence  Mais notre objectif est d’avoir un coup d’avance par rapport à ce qu’il pourrait se passer dans la nature et d’anticiper l’apparition d’une mutation traitée en laboratoire

Si on prend les example conspirationistes un par un on peut les ridiculiser tant qu'on veux   Mais quand on les regardes objectivement et on prend le temps de les comprendres on fini par avoir une vue d'ensemble de la situation et on y voie une logique très forte qui n'a rien de farfelue  Beaucoup plus logique que la version officielle des faits    On fini par réaliser qu'on se fait endormir totalement

C'est exact ce sont toutes les combinaisons possibles je sais que cela ne dit rien à la population en général mais chaque virus a un nom spécifique 

Avant 1918 c'était surtout les virus de type A(H2N8) et A(H3N8) qui circulaient ils étaient de souche aviaire porcine mais aussi chevaline 

Mais le virus A(H1N1) existait déjà au début des années 1900 en 1915 il était apparu puis à l'hiver 1917-1918 il frappait le Canton de Chine très contagieux
mais il ressemblait encore à une grippe saisonnière 
Un bataillon de soldats américains rentrant à leur base à Boston et des Chinois qui immigraient en grande quantité aux É U  en Caroline du Sud ont emméné le virus avec eux même que les porcs étaient contaminés par la grippe 

La première vague de mars 1918 à juin 1918 mais déjà il y avait eu plusieurs cas avant qu'on parle d'épidémie ressemblait à une grippe sasionnière mais la grippe ne s'est jamais arrêtée finalement 

La deuxième vague a débuté fin août 1918 c'est surtout vers le milieu de sept  1918 que les cas de grippe sont devenus extrêmement virulents c'est à ce moment qu'on a commencé à compter les morts 
En 7 jours elle avait traversé les É U  et en 15 jours l'Amérique du Nord au grand complet  Le port du masque a fait son apparrition

La question: Est-ce que la course au vaccin réussira à devancer la pandémie?  Réponse Non! Elle la créera 
Quand enfin sera venu votre tour comme certains l'espèrent il n'y aura plus besoin de vaccins parce que la pandémie    la VRAIE pas la nouvelle version corrigée par l'OMS  mais la vraie    elle sera là! La vrai cette fois  Là enfin vous saurez faire la différence entre une pandémie et une propagande une PUB de pandémie  Ce petit vaccin ce mélange fabriqué en laboratoire du virus de porc (virus air born mais non mortel) du virus d'oiseaux (virus non air born mais mortel) mis ensemble    imaginez la chance que vous avez    ajoutez à cela dans la petite fiole du virus de l'influenza humain du mercure du formaldéhyde de l'alluminium du squalène (qui a provoqué le problème qui se caractérise par des symptômes comme des troubles du système immunitaire et des malformations congénitales nommé Syndrome de la guerre du golf) ou le tristement célèbre MF59 qui est semblable et voilà ce qui attaquera les corps des vaccinés  Les maladies qui attaqueront les vaccinés et sa virulence sera sans précédent    La grippe de 14-18 c'est de la petite bière à coté de ce que ce vaccin va induire dans les sociétés  Ne vous inquiétez pas ça ne s'arrêtera pas là    Le malheur ne vient jamais seul    en ce moment ça tombe tellement bien on OUVRE les esprits les médias commencent à faire une autre pub  Celle de l'euthanasie    La majorité des médecins canadiens sont maintenant pour  Quand la vraie pandémie lancée par les vaccins va soumettre une bonne partie des populations dans des souffrances jusqu'ici à peine imaginables    imaginez le reste

Je crois qu'il est essentiel de chiffrer en pourcentage les chances de contracter le virus H1N1 et d'en mourir  Cela je l'espère rassurera plusieurs personnes 

Le 29 octobre il y avait un cumulatif de 95 personnes décédées de la grippe A H1N1 (depuis le début de la grippe) 

Nous sommes présentement 33 831 000 personnes au Canada 

Alors statistiquement les chances de contracter le virus H1N1 et d'en mourir sont de 0 00028 % 

Donc c'est très mince comparé à d'autres maladies

Oui c'est une question de gestion de risques  C'est juste qu'il y a une inconnue dans cette équation: les effets à long terme 

Le syndrome de Guillain-Barré fait partie des effets indésirables qui se manifestent assez rapidement après la vaccination  Les seuls effets secondaires mesurés dans les études cliniques sur les vaccins sont ceux à court terme (généralement pas plus de six) sur des sujets adultes généralement en bonne santé  La grande aberration scientifique dans tout ça c'est que depuis des décennies qu'on vaccine ni les fabricants de vaccins ni les autorités de santé publique n'ont jamais jugé bon de vérifier sur le terrain l'hypothèse que les vaccins sont sécuritaires à long terme par des études cliniques méthodologiquement dignes de ce nom 

* Le mercure est une substance neuro-toxique qui traverse les barrières placentaire et sang-cerveau
* l'aluminium est toxique entre autres pour le système nerveux et les reins
* les adjuvants de type émulsion huile/eau (même si c'est juste de la vitamine E) comme le AS03 sont reconnus comme étant dévastateurs pour le système immunitaire  Ils sont utilisés sur les animaux de laboratoire pour leur provoquer des maladies auto-immunes    Ses effets à long terme sont inconnus puisqu'injectés aux humains depuis quelques années seulement 

On vous injecte des substances scientifiquement reconnues toxiques pour le cerveau et le système immunitaire à répétition sans en mesurer les effets à long terme ou même quelle idée saugrenue leur interaction entres elles ou avec une condition physique préalable  Les troubles envahissants de développement chez les enfants sont en progression alarmantes à un taux d'un enfant sur 166  Les maladies auto-immunes plus de 80 répertoriées affectent chroniquement 5 à 8% de la population 

Pourtant on se moque des scientifiques qui émettent l'hypothèse qu'il pourrait y avoir des liens entre ces problèmes et les vaccins de plus en plus nombreux   

Mais rassurez-vous disent les bons docteurs «c'est notre domaine on connaît ça faites-vous vacciner!» Les femmes les enfants et les immuno-supprimés d'abord!   

BRAVO aux «spin doctors» qui ont habilement fait bifurquer le débat de la pertinence et la sécurité du vaccin à la gestion de cette non-crise

L'opposition fait de la démagogie pour se faire du capital politique en insinuant que le gouvernement est à blâmer pour les limites logistiques de la production du vaccin  Celui-ci est produit par une compagnie privée qui ne peut fournir qu'une quantité limitée du vaccin en fonction du capital matériel et humain dont elle dispose  On ne peut fabriquer 50 millions de doses d'un vaccin en 24 heures  Le gouvernement a également commandé des vaccins sans adjuvant pour les femmes enceintes ce qui retarde la production des vaccins avec adjuvants 

On pourrait blâmer le gouvernement si l'État était propriétaire des moyens de production de l'industrie pharmaceutique ou encore si les problèmes se trouvaient principalement au niveau de la distribution et de l'administration du vaccin ce qui n'est pas le cas  C'est un problème de production qui sort du contrôle de l'État  La production est contrôlée par le privé et puisqu'il n'existe pratiquement pas de compétition dans ce secteur particulier le gouvernement ne peut rien y changer 

On devrait plutôt blâmer le gouvernement pour avoir commandé des millions de doses d'un vaccin inutile et dangeureux (youtube: cheerleader) contre un virus moins contagieux que la grippe saisonnière et qui a tué cent fois moins que la moyenne annuelle  Mais ça c'est une autre histoire

Je trouve cela bien drôle quand on compare une grippe au bogue de l'an 2000
le SRAS ou la grippe aviaire   

La crainte du bogue de 2000 a peut-être été perçu par certaines personnes comme la fin du monde mais c'est une minorité qui ont cru cela   on a juste changer de siècle 
Le SRAS (syndrome respiratoire aigu sévère) qui n'est pas un virus de grippe même si il affecte les poumons étaient très contagieux et beaucoup plus mortel que la grippe en général  Le nom le dit bien sévère 
On a pris les grands moyens quanrantaine que ça plaise ou non !
Il existe plusieurs maladies respiratoires qui ne sont dues à la grippe et qui causent plein de problèmes sérieux et même mortels la tuberculose a fait de nombreuses victimes mais ce n'était pas une grippe 
On a pas parlé du SRAS pendant plusieurs mois avant que cela arrive comme
on le fait présentement avec la grippe A(H1N1) alors que la pandémie est annoncée depuis plusieurs mois 

La grippe aviaire n'a jamais été une vraie menace pour les humains en général elle a fait peu de victimes en comparaison avec les autres grippes les véritables victimes étaient les poulets et ça c'est passé dans les poulaillers si on ne avait pas tué tous ces poulets ou volailles seraient mortes quand même de la grippe 
Le danger avec la grippe aviaire était pour les gens en contact direct avec les poulets pas pour la population humaine cette grippe extrêmement virulente et voir mortelle pour la grande majorité de ceux qui l'ont attrappée mais elle ne transmettait d'humain à humain 
Si elle devient un jour une grippe humaine ce serait avec la manipualtion des hommes !
La grippe est semble-t-il une des vieilles maladies du monde depuis plus de 40 ans on vaccine les plus à risque dit-on les personnes âgées et les personnes avec des maladies chroniques mais cela n'a jamais empêché les gens de mourir de la grippe même des vaccinés et les cas de grippe ne diminuent aucunement car la population change très vite 

Bien sûr qu'aujourd'hui les soins de santé sont différents que dans les années 1918 1957-1968 et même 1976 lors des autres épidémies mais elle peut encore tuer car elle est surnoise et quand elle frappe on est pas toujours dans nos meilleures conditions généralement en hiver ou d'autres infections circulent
rhumes ce n'est pas parce qu'on a pas de maladies chroniques ou autres gros problèmes de santé qu'on est néssairement en super forme et non vulnérable à un virus

There's a Critical Difference Between Now and 1976

Alas there was another virulent contagion missing from America in 1976 i e  the plague of Republicanism spread by an ignorant lazy herd of bovine half-wits wallowing in the toilet of Republican talk radio  A disease that would surely cause those afflicted to welcome the deaths of thousands Americans in the hopes of discrediting the President of the United States just as they now spend their days dreaming of teabagging Dick Cheney and salivating over the prospect of another 9/11 attack

What the American press nor the politicians want the public to know   

Want to know more about how this swine flu has come about? Try these two web sites   you'll be sickened for sure    something the American corporate protectionist press will not cover    

http://www grist org/article/2009-04-25-swine-flu-smithfield/

and this Dec  14 2006 Rolling Stone expose' will let you connect the dots   as well as showing you just how toxic these pig sh!t pools are   people have jumped in after others who have fallen in and they all die  This has happened a number of times   literally dying of Pig sh!t  People who live around these pools often get sick from the stench and the ground water pollution  Maybe now were all going to die of pig sh!t-related Swine flu  They have polluted the ground water and the air   fertilize plants with the chemical laced toxic pig sh!t pools  http://www rollingstone com/politics/story/12840743/porks_dirty_secret_the_nations_top_hog_producer_is_also_one_of_americas_worst_polluters

I hope Luter falls into one of his own pig sh!t ponds  Even back in 2006 he was going into Poland and other places in Europe and other countries and doing the same things there as he has done in the US  ie: monopolize chemicalize and pollute  As the first article will tell you   this Swine flu started at or near the Mexican Smithfield operations

This is dangerous thinking

This is like saying Hey I've run this light before and nothing bad happened so I'm going to run it again  We already know that this disease 1) is passed from person to person and 2) can be fatal to many who get it  That is very different from the 1976 swine flu based on what you wrote in this article  Panic is always bad but let's not go the other direction and pretend that there is nothing bad happening  This may or may not be the big one but we're better off assuming the worst and hoping for the best than vice versa

2009 Not 1976

There are surely lessons to be heeded from the 1976 Swine Flu debacle but it really is problematic that this article didn't point out the glaring differences from an infectious disease perspective 

In 1976 one person died and the flu's spread was limited to a single local community  In 2009 we face a situation where 100s of people have already died and the spread appears to already be in multiple countries  This is a far more serious situation and one that remains highly uncertain changing day by day  It will be almost impossible for governments to find the right line between caution and action here because to do nothing could result in a massive human tragedy (if the virus has the 7% fatality rate as it has demonstrated in Mexico) and yet to do too much could be embarrassing and damaging (if the virus quickly mutates into a weaker strain)  We expect a lot from governments in these situations but it's a gamble pure and simple  No one actually knows what this virus will do

I think that the point of the article isn't that we should ignore the situation because of the past but not allow interested parties to panic us and then force others toward uncessessary actions because of our panic  Ford really had every reason to sound the alarm   I'm thinking that he didn't think that he knew more about flu than viriologists and when the outbreak first occurred he listened to them  The problem was that when it became apparrent that it was not a plague destined to kill millions they went through with a rushed vaccine for political reasons 

There is a lot we don't know right now  Unfortunately we feel that we need to know instantaneously and there will be people who will let us connect the dots  We don't know for instance what the mortality rate is  We don't even know if all of those deaths in Mexico are swine flu related (they are reported not confirmed) how many of those sick people have this flu or something similar  Since the cases in the U S  have been mild there are probably more than a few cases in Mexico where a lot of people in Mexico who felt a little under the weather and didn't go to the doctor  We know about the reported deaths because it is hard not to notice the dead but at the beginning of an outbreak mild cases of the disease are under reported  But because we don't know someone here did the math of the reported cases to reported deaths and came up with a 7% mortality rate   which is unbearably high almost unbelievably so  It's numbers like that generalized to fill gaps in knowlege that will lead to an outcome like 1976 

There will be many people connecting dots as that is what people do  We do know a lot more about viruses than we did in 1976 so we should be able to develop a vaccine more quickly  Unfortunately none of that knowledge will do us any good if we allow someone to step in with a politically expedient fix  Unfortunately I don't think our media and political culture have evolved since 1976  Somehow someone on the right is going to make certain that any bungling on this matter will be seen as worse than the response to hurricane Katrina so that Obama won't recieve credit and some yahoo on the left will point out that any bumgling of the matter is caused by a broken system left by the Bush administration 

At this point I'm inclined to listen to CDC doctors who are working on the problem not experts hired to be interviewed and give sound bites on CNN who aren't doctors or who haven't worked on this situation and know just as much as the rest of us about what is going on  Willing to look slow to get the science done is going to be one of the struggles for this administration

Mortality rate 

Actually that mortality rate mentioned early is MUCH too high 

It's been downgraded do to the fact that mamy people who were sick did not report to hospitals and recovered just fine  If 100 people reported illness and 6 died--that's a high mortality rate 

If 1000 people were sick and 6 died those are very different odds

Prudence v Panic

I agree that the current swine flu outbreak is being expectably mishandled by a degenerate press and probably even fuelled by an even more degenerate pharmaceutical industry  The story itself is a far greater threat than the disease 

But there is a story here  If we would all insist that the news media begin to place the story in a factual historical context it might contibute to the end of pandering and panic-pushing in the media

Is our government more capable now than in 1976?

Is it reasonable to be concerned about the swine flu cases in Mexico and the US? Yes  Was it reasonable to be concerned in 1976? Yes 

It sounds like in 1976 the scientists made a mistake and the government responded because it was politically convenient to do so  When the scientists acknowledged their mistake the government did not react because it was not politically convenient 

So far the US government response to the 2009 infections seems eminently reasonable  Hopefully we won't repeat the sort of mistakes made in the past   our government is much more sensitive to charges of bureaucracy than it was 33 years ago and we have a popular president with plenty of other things to worry about besides an unnecessary immunization program  Plus it seems that President Obama errs on the side of considering too many points of view before acting a trait that would come in handy when preventing a knee-jerk response or a panic 

On the other hand it was only seven years ago that the department of homeland security was urging everyone to go out and buy duct tape

Parallels

Since I'm old enough to remember this excellent piece by Patrick Di Justo made me think about the parallels between Gerald Ford's political opportunity to show the country that he/the government was in command of the situation and George W  Bush's invasion of Iraq to show that he/the government was in command of the situation 

Of the two Ford was far more competent but he bungled things like saying the 1976 flu version was the same as the Spanish Flu just as Bush bungled things like saying Saddam Hussein had a stockpile of nuclear weapons 

At both times the country was kind of meandering in terms of what it was really doing and what the agenda was  Both of these presidents seized on the concept of crisis as a defining moment of leadership  The fact that both were/are Republicans makes it more interesting  Ford was still stumbling from the Nixon resignation and pardon and Bush was stumbling from just lack of anything to say and do and an inability to properly process what happened on 9/11 

Of the two Ford's move was relatively innocuous (even inoculus)  But the parallel is interesting 

Other similarities exist: in the 1970's Saturday Night Live satirized Ford as a physical and verbal stumbler  30 years later Bush received very similar treatment in the verbal stumbling category although not exclusively

How to tell a brain-fried conspiracy junkie

He blames conspiracy when simple stupidly (fueled in this case by panic) suffices 

In 1976 there were still plenty of people around -- though all of them were quite elderly -- who had lived through the 1918 pandemic  They knew what a pandemic looked like and their memories helped drive the official response  (Oh and by the way pharmaceutical companies tend to lose money on vaccines  So there's no profit for them in a flu outbreak )

Good coverage but short on the science 

This is a good synopsis of the 1976 event - but you might be forgetting that this was only 50 years after the 1918 influenza that killed about 100 million people worldwide and pretty much everyone who was an adult had been impacted in some form or fashion by that epidemic 

Private Lewis showed influenza in his lung tissue after the autopsy  There was no way at the time to determine whether it was a similar strain to 1918 or not as no one anywhere on the globe had recovered and sequenced the genetic code for the 1918 strain 

The author is correct however that the main concern the Ford administration had was whether 1976 was going to be another 1918  The science establishment at the time had no clue what the 1918 flu looked like or even where it originated and the government's overreaction to a single death was made with many forgivable lapses in general knowledge  Among them:

* Stockpiling enough vaccine would take 9-12 months  The 1918 epidemic did all of its damage in the course of about three 

* Ford had no dissenting voices among his science cabinet when the decision was made  It was judged a prudent effort and they went ahead 

* The vaccination of fifty million people was predicted by the CDC to result in coincidental relationships (such as the false linking of Giullian-Barre syndrome) between vaccination and sickness  This was considered an acceptable risk at the time 

* 1976 was on the right point in time to coincide with pandemic influenza - the cycle time was correct for a highly-infectious version to appear (it cycles over the course of about two decades between very innocuous and highly infectious) 

* To the best of their knowledge Mr  Matthews was correct - if the 1976 flu was a match for 1918 it would kill a million people 

Today's flu situation is a little different - for example we now have a complete genome of the 1918 flu and can see what made it so lethal  Prevailing theory holds that it was an avian variety that somehow managed to not only jump species to humans but also was able to retain that foothold and thrive in human tissue - something that avian flu does not normally have the capacity to do 

At the present time we have knowledge of many of the effects of 1918's abilities such as an enhanced ability to suppress cellular production of interferon - which makes it much harder for us to fight it off  We also are familiar with its structural nature that 1918 was an H1 variety (H1 referring to a type of hemagluttenin protein on its surface there are many types each referred to by H# to differentiate them in recordkeeping)  Highly virulent forms are generally of the H1 variety (major pandemics are most often of this type) though exceptions will likely occur 

What I'm getting at here is that yes - Obama's administration will be forced to decide a difficult choice on whether or not to launch a massive campaign to immunize against this strain  However today as opposed to 1976 the administration will have access to much more detailed and reliable information regarding the nature of the flu at hand  Given this administration's leanings towards good science Obama will have have the luxury of taking advantage of that information whereas Ford did not 

My apologies for the following but I must point out a particularly salient political point here  Retrospectively we can thank our gods/stars/countrymen that the blissfully ignorant McCain and that bumbling fool Palin are not in the White House - because they would likely have slid any report regarding a potential epidemic into the same circular file that the prior administration slid the report regarding Osama bin Laden being determined to attack from within the United States  It is precisely because of the Republican aversion to good science that they should be eradicated from the American political theater 

So before you go vote in the mid-terms think about that very very carefully  Without science we are terribly vulnerable to a great many hidden and surprising foes in nature  Republicans have repeatedly and faithfully (no pun intended) demonstrated an abhorrence of science since it often conflicts with their fantasy-land ideology  That's not to say Democrats are perfect but they have at least shown they are willing look at the numbers and re-evaluate their position based on fact (as opposed to flip-flopping randomly to appease voting blocks)  Consider the position of the candidates whenever you go to vote  Because in the end you must bring yourself to the realization:

Your own vote can kill you

As with everything in life it is best to be prepared  While the government needs to inform its populace    without creating panic    it is up to each individual to care for their own well being and that of their family members  Here is a link to the CDC for information on how to protect you and your family from the the Swine Flu  http://pfx me/Nz

Thanks Thomas for that great post 

And it's only in hindsight that we can make fun of Ford for causing a panic  If things had gone the way his scientists had suggested they might he might have saved tens of thousands of lives    (and we'd still probably make fun of him) 

Re making vaccine the technology exists currently to have enough vaccine to immunize everyone for this strain by summertime if there is will (and money) to do so

Short Pork Bellies

Given the world we live in I wonder how many Americans will think that swine flu can be contracted by eating pork? Short pork bellies SELL Mortimer SELL and   

Pandemic     one more word that strikes terror and fear in the heart of many         More fuel to the obsessive/compulsive fire   Many Americans(not all) already worry about high cholesterol heart attacks diabetes acid reflux gall bladder pancreatic colon lung cancer I know I have missed a few diseases/ailments to worry about   now they can add the swine flu pandemic to the list      One more item for the pharmaceutical industry to make millions from    I read that Baxter is already at work     

Suggest everyone see the movie FoodInc when it comes out      just some food for thought

Mortality and What We Don't Know

Luna Girl I am well aware of how mortality statistics work  The 7% figure was an early figure and likely inaccurate but we don't have an accurate figure from Mexico right now  I was simply stating that IF that statistic or even a 2 or 3% mortality were to prove true elsewhere in the world (the 1918 pandemic had about a 2 5% mortality rate; the current avian flu H5N1 is presumed to have a mortality rate of 20% or greater but has low transmissibility ) this would be a devastating event warranting the utmost action by governments and intense media coverage  (Since many people seem to prematurely believe there is an over-reaction ) The stark reality is we don't know right now and the picture is changing day to day  More information is needed before we have any idea if we are in danger of either over-reaction or under-reaction 

Thomas Theobold your letter was a better summary than the article! 1976 is as important in its differences as it is in its similarities to what's happening now  Understanding both will be vital to making useful decisions

Good to know what happened but   

It is good to know what happened (or what didn't happen) in 1976 but it would be wrong to make policy makers or the general public think we are in a similar situation  A mass hysteria about a possible epidemic should be avoided while maximum precautions for worst scenarios should be taken  Also let people know the government has not underestimated the situation

Easily treated with homeopathy

During the Spanish influenza epidemic in 1918 the people who fared best were those being treated by homeopathic physicians who lost very few patients to a flu that was a genuine killer 

Homeopathy is brilliant with flu any kind or strain  Washington Homeopathic Pharmacy (http://www homeopathyworks com/ (I am not affiliated in any way) is an excellent source of information and products that can help a family stay healthy even if you have no health insurance at very affordable prices  Oscillococcinum produced by the Boiron pharmacy is a product available in most drugstores and supermarkets and if taken at the first sign of flu or even if you think you might have been exposed can prevent or greatly reduce symptoms 

A wonderful book if you can find it is Who Is Your Doctor And Why? by Alonzo Shadman  It tells the history of homeopathic medicine in the U S  and how it was almost wiped out by the burgeoning pharmaceutical industry in the early part of the 20th century much to the detriment of the country's health care  In most parts of the world homeopathy is an accepted part of standard medical care but in the U S  it has been relegated to the fringes  A real shame  The royal family of England has a homeopathic physician as their primary care giver  Say what you will of them but they do live a long time barring accident 

The downside of homeopathy is that it requires you to take responsibility for your own health  Many people really do not want to do that  They want to go to a doctor and be told what to do and to take some drug and not have to think about it  I prefer the former but recognize that it's not for everyone  Another consideration is that most homeopathic remedies are antidoted (stopped in their action) by mint  Many people have taken a remedy at bedtime right before or after brushing their teeth with a mint toothpaste and have concluded that homeopathy just doesn't work  So if you are going to use this method of healing consider a non-mint toothpaste  Most health food stores and Trader Joe's as well carry fennel toothpastes that will not interfere with homeopathic remedies 

So - if you decide to forego the flu shots - I personally don't bother with them - and don't have the money or inclination for anti-virals like Tamiflu - you may consider homeopathy as a way to deal with this and any other outbreak 

Cheers

in the army

So I was back from Vietnam five years in 1976  I can tell you the army is famous for its really really lousy food  It is amazing that we all made it through basic training at Ft Ord California back in 1969  When fifty men are put together from all over the USA in a barrack of 200 others the food is terrible and the harassment constant and then add the vaccinations given (without looking to see who might react or what is in the vaccines)    it is truly a wonder there are not more sick    I suggest the autopsy was probably about as good as our care was    so they needed a fear factor well swine flu probably fit the bill 

This is all a need for diversion   we no longer have OJ to divert our attention nor Michael Jackson    these are old news    and not very frightening  So we need something almost as frightening as 9/11 or anthrax    Yeah swine flu   that will do it  Besides the idea of real and I mean real subpoenas and indictments regarding torture murder fraud and more is a bit much for those supposedly in charge 

Now then  am not saying they have not concocted a real situation and that we shouldn't be taking action   But take a flu shot? You've got to be kidding   no way

Mexico City flu and the recent municipal water cut-off

I have wondered if the spreading of the flu in Mexico City may have been aided by the cutting off of the municipal water supply for days about 2 months ago  This would have expanded the use of water trucks throughout the city - into neighborhoods that normally do not need that service - and also expanded the need for more water trucks  The shortage of that number of trucks needed could have meant that trucks that are used in pig farms to water the stock were sent into Mexico City  - and where does one fill up the truck to bring the water into the city?

What may have been a supplying of a needed resource could have helped to create the disaster of the spread from human to pig of this virus - while it may only have taken a few infected indians entering the City through Terminal Tapo also - I am wondering if there were any links to the earlier water cut-off

One other thing   

During a typical year in the United States 30000 to 50000 persons die as a result of influenza viral infection  Frequently cited numbers are 20000 deaths each year and 37000 annual deaths  About 5-10% of hospitalizations for influenza lead to fatal outcome in adults 

http://www globalsecurity org/security/ops/hsc-scen-3_flu-pandemic-deaths htm

Thus one death and dozens of infections from an unusual strain of influenza in the U S  is not indication of a need to stockpile Tamiflu and Relenza - and it is still not clear that this strain is very unusual  Influenza is more dangerous for people with impaired immune systems and lungs and all the pollution in Mexico City means there is plenty of that 

The only people who really should take flu shots are the infirm elderly and people at high risk because of other medical conditions  As far as Tamiflu it should be restricted to use by doctors certainly not available over-the-counter - look at potential side effects:

    Seek medical attention right away if any of these SEVERE side effects occur when using Tamiflu:

    Nausea vomiting Severe allergic reactions (rash hives itching difficulty breathing tightness in the chest swelling of the mouth face lips or tongue) confusion hallucinations or other unusual changes in behavior fever or sore throat reddened blistered or swollen skin seizures severe or persistent vomiting or diarrhea

HIV was not taken seriously by Reagan until Rock Hudson contracted it

How many deaths of both homosexual men and heterosexual men and women over the past 30 years from HIV that was dismissed as a gay disease or god's punishment for promiscuous sexual conduct? We have global travel on a scale that did not exist in 1976 which shows with the rapid spread of the NAFTA CFCO swine flu with tourists returning from many parts of Mexico coming down with the disease  And like HIV the early deaths and the deaths coming in daily from Mexico are being listed often as pneumonia as the doctors are under orders not to put flu on the death certificates  No one really knows and government officials do not want to know how serious the problem really is as then they would have to act and for starters shut down the CAFO plant in Vera Cruz

Consult your physician!!!!!!

I just received an email passed on to me by a friend who is also a genetics scientist  In that forwarded message a person who is (claimed to be) a doctor tells of hospital and city health officials sounding a warning that this is the real deal: a pandemic with the potential for a significant fatality rate 

The email claims this N1H1 (Swine Flu) virus does not show symptoms for two days then the infected person becomes infectious to others for 7-9 days  This profile: if true : is pretty scary because it means this flu can spread silently as well as during the symptom bearing phase 

The email also states that they expect the president to declare an emergency: under which public gatherings would be banned for a period of about 10 days 

They go on to recommend anti-viral drugs and wearing a medical mask (as well as frequent hand-washing) 

I do NOT trust this entirely: never trust something forwarded by anyone no matter what their qualifications  My friend opens with the statement that they have not verified this themselves 

INSTEAD: I WILL CALL MY PHYSICIAN and ask about this email and ask for their recommendations 

I will ALSO continue monitoring the CDC website for their updates (which they are issuing daily)  http://www cdc gov/swineflu/

So far the CDC is saying things similar to what are in the email: avoid crowds especially in closed locations check with your physician about anti-viral drugs and wearing a mask etceteras 

I well remember the ridiculous Swine Flu scare of 1976: I can say that this is different because this flu has killed people in several states and is spreading rapidly  During the 1976 scare: we simply waited and waited - there never was another fatality or any evidence of a flu epidemic 

Whatever you do: do NOT depend on Fox News to tell you what to do - they've been in a panic since last November and are already feverish enough  -) Just stick with what medical science is telling you (oh I uttered the S word - too bad conservatives)

Are we ever going to learn?

All that hysteria over one death at Fort Dix  I remember those times very well and was thinking of that when I flicked on CNN the other day and Swine Flu was all over the news that day 

I also remember the Killer Bees  The killer bees were coming to get us  That never materialized either 

Why the Swine Flu seems to be killing so many Mexicans was reported quite succinctly by a doctor in Canada who said that Mexicans have poor health care poor sanitation and live in the most polluted and overcrowded city in the world  Those healthy people may not be so healthy  Indeed the single death in the U S  was a Mexican toddler (God rest his soul the poor thing) 

The 1918 flu was not a swine flu it was an avian flu  Avian flus are much more deadly

I was in the US ARMY in 1976 and was given the shot  I didn't want it but was told that we were the Governments guinea pigs and didn't have a choice 

I just pray that this time around that the GOVERNMENT stays the HECK out of it and allows the medical field and scientiest do it right this time----of course Ford and Carter isn't running for President now opps we have Obama

    The fetus fetishists also say that pregnancy is a totally blissful risk-free condition 

    I dunno  If I were in the early stages of a wanted pregnancy and faced either putting myself and future child in an unprecedented experiment or putting myself and perhaps the fetus as well at risk of death from H1N1 I might rethink the timing  Maybe stop this and try again later when more is known

suite101.com,335,###,"vaccineswork :
This comment is dedicated to the public domain  Use as you choose 

The article above should be replaced by the following or something similar

ADJUVANTS AND SQUALENE

This is the situation with the swine flu vaccine and adjuvants especially one you may have heard about called squalene 

The current situation is this: There is no adjuvant no squalene no alum no aluminum salt in any of the swine flu vaccine that will be used in the United State  It's expected that no adjuvants squalene alum or aluminum salt to any swine flu vaccine for the 2009-2010 swine flu season 

There's a very small chance that the CDC might add an adjuvant that contains squalene to the swine flu vaccine  As you know the strain of flu virus that infects people a month from now can be different from the one that infects people today  It's possible that the new strain might be much more dangerous than the one infecting people now  The CDC and others who think that vaccination is safer than not getting vaccinated say that even if the new flu strain is much more dangerous that the vaccine they're using now will be pretty good 

So why would the CDC add squalene? They'll do it because if you add squalene to the vaccine you get vaccinate four times as many people  And if getting infected is more dangerous some of the people who decided not to get vaccinated may change their mind and want to get vaccinated as soon as possible  If that happens the only way to quickly vaccinate them may be to add squalene to the vaccine 

I don't believe that the vaccine works now and I don't believe when they say the flu strain can be more dangerous and yet the vaccine will work       Inset anything desired here 

I support swine flu vaccination  But what I've written above is pretty flat 

Anyone who opposes vaccination shouldn't have any problem with an article like this after adding some flourishes  People opposed to vaccination believe that the public isn't being told the truth they need to know to decide whether they're going to get vaccinated  That's all my suggested article does it give the public information that's as accurate as possible so they can decide to get vaccinated or not on the facts 
Oct 18 2009 11:49 AM
Laura Owens :
Hi

I appreciate your comments  I encourage readers to refer to my sources/resources at the end of my article 

I also encourage open dialogue regarding the flu vaccines  There appears to be a mis-perception that groups are anti-vaccine  While some individuals/orgs ARE several consumer-based groups are simply interested in vaccination safety and presenting credible well-documented research results (and updates) 

All organizations government research and consumer-advocacy groups should post clear truthful and THOROUGH information  In turnthe invididual needs to do their homework  Check out the CDC/WHO and NIH websites  Talk to your doctor and review some of the vaccination-safety consumer sites (all at the end of my article) 

Make a choice based on the facts and what works for you and your family  While I know everyone is busy and doing this much homework seems impractical it's worth the effort  Take a couple hours one week and do it 

I can appreciate your point that there is only a VERY small chance the adjuvant will be added and if so only in the case of a pandemic 

I personally would not want any vaccine that had any adjuvant particularly squalene regardless of the fact that doing so allows manufacturers to maximize production/available doses (because less vaccine is needed to evoke the desired immune response in the individual) in the case of a shortage or pandemic 

While my personal philosophy on the seasonal and swine vaccine is to NOT get it (I prefer to boost my immune system and avoid people who are ill) this is based on a well-researched personal choice  I also however have zero risk factors 

My daughter received all her childhood vaccinations but will not get the the flu vaccines  She also won't be getting the Gardasil vaccine  Too new too many unknowns  I will also find out how she can get her 7th grade DTp with the least amount of preservative (thimerosal) possible 

As for the flu vaccines if I was pregnant or had a two year old or younger a child with risk factors I might re-consider  That being said I would INSIST on the preservative-free (single dose) dead virus form 

The public should do their own homework  Never blindly follow doctor or government recommendations always ask questions  As well do not follow consumer advocacy groups that seem unusually inflammatory and more importantly are not well-documented (backed by research )

Thanks for your time

Guest :
I am confused about squalene and adjuvant  They say there is a vaccination with and without adjuvant but not with or without squalene  So do I want a vaccination without BOTH squalene and adjuvant?
My sister is a thalidomide baby I don't take ANY of what they say about safety of the vaccination at face value  Nor does the family who is in court about PAxil their daughter took and killed herself   and neither should you!

Laura Owens :
Hi

To your question about adjuvant and squalene  Squalene is an oil-based form of an adjuvant and is NOT in the current swine or seasonal flu vaccines 

Only in the event of a pandemic when large doses would be needed quickly would the government add squalene  There ARE small trace amounts of the preservative thimerosal (mercury) in the injected multi-dose form of the swine flu vaccine not in the live nasal spray 

From the National Vaccination Information Center:

Thimerosal WILL be added as a preservative in multi-dose vials of most inactivated (injected) H1N1 swine flu vaccines although there reportedly will be a limited supply of single dose vials of inactivated swine flu vaccine that do not contain thimerosal 

The live virus nasal spray H1N1 vaccine being created by MedImmune will not contain the preservative thimerosal (and live virus swine flu vaccine will not contain an unlicensed adjuvant that may be added to inactivated H1N1 vaccines)

Now it is being described by health authorities as unpredictable  Before that it was described as a pandemic  I guess if you cover all the bases you are bound to be right to some degree

Nothing to worry about: we've all had months to get ready    each and everyone knows exactly what to do and everything is in place isn't that so? After all it's just like seasonal flu is it not?

It could wait until normal flu season which begins in December  Or with the aid of classrooms serving as incubators it could gain strength when summer comes to an end

The more we try to lock ourselves away from nature in our air-conditioned and winter heated domains splashing the 'inner' world with anti-septics cleaner sprays and so on
the less our immune system is able to adapt it's defences to counter what gets thrown at us by peers or contained ventilation systems

Perhaps they can now get out of their Leather chairs and approve H1N1 Vaccine for everyone asap  But through clinics and doctor's offices as waiting in line for 4 hours is not really a great idea

Up to 1 8 million doses of the advjuant-free vaccine from GlaxoSmithKline will be available to Canadians

However they only made 375000 unadjuvanted doses so far from GSK and have the existing Australian CSL nonadjuvant circulating

Butler Jones on TV was pretty much dictating who will get the adjuvant and nonadjuvant now based on availability in the clinics and advising according to their own new criteria

Do Canadians have a choice?

Article states The unadjuvanted vaccine was previously only intended for pregnant women   

That's NOT TRUE  In September Health Canada said there would be 1 8 to 2 million doses of normal (unadulterated) vaccine for pregnant women and young children 

*quote*
Canada will provide normal swine flu vaccine to
pregnant women younger children
Sharon Kirkey Canwest News Service:
Monday September 28 2009
Canada has ordered 1 8 million doses of
unadjuvanted swine flu vaccine for pregnant
women and children under the age of three
Canada's chief public health officer says 


Canada has ordered 1 8 million doses of
unadjuvanted swine flu vaccine for pregnant
women and children under the age of three
Canada's chief public health officer said Friday 

Adjuvants are substances added to vaccines to
boost a person's immune response to the shots 
While the adjuvant to be used in Canada's H1N1
vaccine — an oil-in-water emulsion — is similar
to one that has been used in Europe with seasonal
flu shots and other vaccines Dr  David Butler-
Jones said there's not yet enough clinical data
on adjuvanted vaccines in pregnant women and
children under three 

Those groups will have the option of using an
unadjuvanted vaccine he said 

*unquote*

And of course it would be interesting to know why we ordered 2 million doses for 278000 preganant women  Invites all sorts of questions

The package insert for the Influenza A (H1N1) 2009 Monovalent Vaccine manufactured by Novartis has been leaked on the Internet  According to that package insert the vaccine (based on an earlier vaccine product known as Fluvirin) is known to cause a whole host of very nasty side effects such as guillain-barre syndrome vasculitis anaphylactic shock and even death 

Of course anyone who has been studying vaccine side effects already knows that it causes all of these things but the story here is that the insert for the swine flu vaccine itself is admitting all of these things  The insert says that it was updated during September 2009 so it reflects the very latest information 

You can read the package insert for this vaccine for yourself right here

Back on September 2 2009

Butler-Jones said:

the Government of Canada has decided to use an adjuvanted vaccine to allow for more vaccine to be produced with less antigen needed

No mention of ordering non-adjuvant back in September on Health canada's website

http://www phac-aspc gc ca/alert-alerte/h1n1/conferences/nc-2009-09-02-eng php

This writer CA had an article back in August Canada's flu strategy flawed: CMAJ

Health authorities should roll out non-adjuvant vaccine for children pregnant women and aboriginal communities the same course being taken by the United States and Europe while the rest of the population can wait for the adjuvant vaccine the journal suggested 

http://www theglobeandmail com/news/national/canadas-flu-strategy-flawed-cmaj/article1271216/


What was Health Canada doing?

Were Leona Health and Butler-Jones not listening?

Is that when their cheese fell off their cracker?

What was the deal here?
To compromise the safety of Canadians?

Then they quickly backtracked ordered a supply from Australia for high-priority pregnant women only since GSK were making only adjuvant   

Now they just approved some nonadjuvant from GSK -375000 (still in the warehouse) doses were made so far and they have finally broadened their criteria -

Let's see if the nonadjuvant vaccine gets in the arms of Canadians
Will the clinics have availability?
When is GSK planning to make the remainder 1425000 unaduvanted doses?

Where is our very own Chauncey Gardiner PM in all of this?

What a colossal waste of money and energy for a mild flu  Time for the WHO to change the definition of pandemic and the media to stop playing it up  Health Canada has no credibility as a result of their handling of this

H1N1 that is currently out there is a minor virus in terms of affecting mortality rates 

There are people who are properly concerned    I did not say they knew the answers    I said that they were properly concerned about the 'hype' associated with this virus 

For example:

1: Why would Baxter release 72 kg of live virus for distribution?

2: Why would the WHO issue a pandemic alert when there was/is no pandemic

There are a great many other questions raised at the Canadian website:

I certainly do not know what is going on but the above two items are sufficient for me to be concerned  Something is not right

This has been the most   fiasco of public health I have ever seen  Schools of Management (especially public heath) should use this as a text as to how NOT to micro/mis-manage a crisis (SARS should have taught them something);

First there is little agreement as to who should get it first  Queue jumpers not challenged thus survival of the fittest?;

Ontario so far (including the Chief of Police in Toronto got it as did many hospital donors and board members = shameful = road of blame and shame 

Second everyone blames the other  Feds Provincial Municipal etc 

Third Seasonal flu vaccine is held somewhere and could save far more that the H1N!

Finally WTO recommends antivirals such as Tamiflu  Try and get it anywhere Go see a doctor and incur costs to the provincial health care system for a prescription  The Province of Saskatchewan is the only one providing it FREE so as to lessen deaths 

Is anyone in charge????

I think it's funny to characterize the discussions that way  I've been on many of these H1N1 threads and the bulk of the name calling has been from the detractors of the medical establishment 

I have routinely posted common knowledge points on H1N1 and been called all sorts of names despite making every attempt not to get bogged down into that type of rhetoric 

Peronsally I think you're justifying these anti-social actions because your points and the points of other detractors simply don't hold water 

By all means prove me wrong  List some facts that you can support to back your claims 

I am always up for a open debate on any issue and ALWAYS attempt to be reasonable at the outset of any discussion but on this topic I've yet to find even one single person who could debate the issue from the anti-vaccine perspective in a reasonably respectful fashion 

But again by all means prove me wrong

You can view it that way if you like but from a public health perspective they're likely just adjusting to the version that will coax the most people to get the shot 

So they started with the quicker easier version and moved to the more expensive but more palatable version after they realized the uptake levels and issues related to it

   Considering all the thumbs up on Kool's comments (that were apparently offensive) one can't wonder just who's very exacting standards were offended   

Let me put it this way  I remember a thread on native issues where one poster submitted a VERY racist comment I will not repeat here  It was of course eventually pulled but before it was there were surprisingly dozens of thumbs up 

So I ask does simple majority agreement make rascism okay?

If not then why would other equally outrageous comments like say calling the people who disagree with you terrorists and nazis be okay?

The point of these discussion thread is to communicate various points of view and debate contentious points or try to sway one another with reasoned advocacy 

I think our capacity to have a meaningful discussion is limited however when we allow brutal attacks to quash the opinions of others and I should hope that all well intentioned people would feel the same 

To me they might as well just stop having discussion boards if we're going to let abusive individuals simply beat everyone else down

All governments have adopted the policy of not keeping statistics of people who dieed or became seriously ill after receiving the vaccine  Why?

   Those of us who ask honest questions are derided as moonbats conspiracy theorists moon-landing deniers and the tinfoil hat crowd by those who repeat untrue statements about the vaccinea and refuse to address simple questions    So when they debase the discussion like that I think 'over-the-top comments like those from Kool are to be expected  And are acceptable in context of how pro-vaccine commentors have damaged the open discussion   

I think it's funny to characterize the discussions that way  I've been on many of these H1N1 threads and the bulk of the name calling has been from the detractors of the medical establishment 

I have routinely posted common knowledge points on H1N1 and been called all sorts of names despite making every attempt not to get bogged down into that type of rhetoric 

Peronsally I think you're justifying these anti-social actions because your points and the points of other detractors simply don't hold water 

By all means prove me wrong  List some facts that you can support to back your claims 

I am always up for a open debate on any issue and ALWAYS attempt to be reasonable at the outset of any discussion but on this topic I've yet to find even one single person who could debate the issue from the anti-vaccine perspective in a reasonably respectful fashion 

But again by all means prove me wrong 

=============

That's a pack of lies

That is a lovely chart & the Public Health Agency of Canada has provided all the data shown Province & number of dead attributed to H1N1 

Now when it's said the number of deaths confirmed as being due to H1N1 influenza 

Does that mean those who died were actually tested for H1N1 or is it simply assumed they had H1N1?

Frankly the word confirmed is very elusive in this context & doesn't tell me much!

I mean they could have said after testing the number of confirmed deaths has risen due to H1N1 influenza 

Also how many of the confirmed dead received the H1N1 vaccine?

Surely records are kept of those who received the H1N1 flu shot & checking said records would be very simple!

A breakdown of age & sex along with figures on how many of the dead received the flu shot would also be nice 

I'm sorry are my questions to much a little over the top or unnecessary?

Am I out of line asking to be provided with such information?

Why are seniors over 65 at the end of the queue?
Once could almost assume that they consider these individuals expendable  Just think of the saving that will accrue if large numbers of seniors succumb to H1N1  Reduction in Old Age and Canada Pension Plan payments  These same individuals will be permanently eliminated from the health care system and will provide nursing homes with relief from overcrowding  The governments wins on this all the way around

Polish health Minister( she is a doctor ) just said that H1N1 is a total hoax and she says that seasonal flu is more dangerous and kills more people   She says that even her doesn't have enough information about the new vaccines and she doesn't want to risk well being of Polish citizens ! How Canadian Minister can do the opposite without any confirmation if the vaccine is Ok  ???????

I wonder how many of those so militantly opposed to the H1N1 vaccine have had this flu? My guess would be damned few 

I did  You don't want to  If I were you (or if I had a time machine and a dose) I'd get the shot and I'm afraid of needles

Canadian H1N1 vaccine without adjuvant OK'd

Health Canada has approved the use of adjuvant-free swine flu vaccine made in Canada for pregnant women and healthy people aged 10 to 64 federal health officials announced Friday  (Nov 13)

Up to 1 8 million doses of the adjuvant-free vaccine from GlaxoSmithKline will eventually be available to Canadians said Dr  David Butler-Jones Canada's chief public health officer 

Using the unadjuvanted vaccine will allow more Canadians to be immunized sooner Butler-Jones said at a news conference  This vaccine has been shown to be very effective in those with healthy immune systems 

                                                 

NOT TRUE

The nonadjuvant is being reserved for pregnant women - the clinics are still saying this!

The clinics are still refusing to give nonadjuvant vaccine to healthy people age 10-64

Dr Butler-Jones key word is eventually

probably the 1 8M unadjuvanted doses from GSK were never distributed let alone administered   

Was the CLS nonadjuvant order deemed enough for pregnant women?

Dr FIB-Butler-Jones is his new name from now on

In B C  we should probably prioritize people by their Carbon footprint 

Those who produce less carbon should get the vaccine first those who drive SUVs get it last 

Perhaps those with very high carbon scores could wear jackets with stars on them so we could identify them properly 

In that way we could save the planet at the same time

I am not sure why there is such a focus on priority groups because it is actually healthy adults between the ages of 19 and 40 who are most at risk but they are not considered by the government to be a priority group  Just look at the deaths - they are not street people babies or pregnant women         they are healthy men and women including teens and the two 40 something teachers in Alberta  I do see the Olympic Torch team did get priority access  We are not getting the straight goods from any governments  I also am curious as to why the Harper crowd keeps saying they have delivered 6 million doses to the provinces yet the larger provinces are reporting receiving 100000 or so doeses  Something isn't right here and the politicians need to come clean

Double the vaccine distribution rate of the United States in a third of the time 

Two weeks ahead of schedule 

World leader in percentage of population vaccinated 

20 Million doses of vaccine over ordered the remainder will go to the third world 

Five percent of the number of deaths compared to the seasonal flu over the same six month time period  95 vs 2000+ deaths over 6 months 

Most of the world has not even started vaccinating yet 

The Liberals are creating fear an paranoia in the Canadian population  Canadians are crapping themselves in fear standing in the rain and cold because the failed corrupt Liberal regime has created a wedge issue out of their health 

Canadians are already starting to calm down  The Liberals can not afford for Canadians to calm down  It will allow them to start thinking again

These are the same ideologues who created the SARS crisis and the followers of the Katrina crowd 

The problem isn't government the problem is we've elected in people who don't believe in government and are doing everything possible to undermine it

According to a spokesman for the BC Health Dept  The H1N1 flu should peak in BC in the next 2 weeks  She also stated that the vaccination programme should be completed by around Christmas if all goes well  Add to that the fact that the vaccination requires a week to 10 days to begin giving a recipient some protection and one has to wonder why anyone would bother getting vaccinated come mid to latter November let alone in December 

To have been truly effective the whole vaccination programme should have been completed long before now  It looks as if the best we can hope for now is for the hospitals and clinics to be on top of their game  The pro-active phase has obviously fallen short of the mark  Let's hope the reactive phase make up for it

What if this isn't pure fear mongering at it's best the 'big pharma' soley out to make $ etc etc ??? Wouldn't you rather be safe than sorry and just protect yourself and everyone else for that matter or at least give in to the indisputable fact that we have a problem here - more than just bad government media etc?

This is a viscious circle we have been backed into people are dieing of the swine flu and flu as well as the fact that there are people dieing and being injured from vaccinations!
Something very wrong and suspicous is happening around the world! I discovered this news story last night and believe we need quality law enforcement and forensic professionals to deeply and thoroughly investigate this virus and vaccine?
Here is the news story I discovered:http://www belfasttelegraph co uk/news/local-national/boy-rushed-to-hospital-after-swine-flu-jab-14543347 html

Boy Rushed To Hospital After Swine Flu Jab

The safety of Northern Ireland’s swine flu vaccination programme was called into question today by the parent of a young special needs pupil who ended up in hospital just hours after getting the jab 
Anne Marie Fletcher said she feared her 15-year-old son Rhys was going to die as she rushed him to hospital less than 24 hours after receiving the swine flu vaccine 
The teenager fell seriously ill after receiving the injection along with thousands of other pupils across Northern Ireland last Friday  He was later diagnosed with swine flu 
“My husband drove us to Antrim (Area Hospital) and I sat in the back with Rhys” she told the Belfast Telegraph 
“By this stage he was going into spasms  He couldn’t bend his fingers  I was absolutely terrified 
“He was rambling and becoming incoherent  I honestly thought he was going to die in the back of the car

To date less people have died of the flu in Canada than in previous years  I guess the media paranoia generated by???? to ensure excessive money being spent on a vaccine is par for the course for a fraud-artist gov't  Everyone was assured that there was MORE than enough there ain't (usual conservative scam)  The actual danger from this virus is being questioned daily by healthcare professionals yet the harper recessionals are going gaga on ensuring that some companies are making probably billions       guess little stevie couldn't find an honest tory airline deal and now we have the utmost in incredible BS   could hamper economic recovery????? harper and his cons constantly lying and stealing hamper no destroy economic recovery  I guess the obvious is the only answer       the only good tory is a dead tory

The health care workers I know and work with estimate that those who would have gotten the shot will be getting their flu shots near the end of the flu season thanks mainly to the hype and hysteria that the governments (federal and provincial) big pharma and the press have been whipping up in the last few months 

It is a fiasco yes but mainly as yet another example that politicians should not be allowed to interfere in health matters - from vaccinations to addictions  Instead we see hype hysteria panic but not much action  Oh and lets not forget huge profits for certain corporations involved in the fiasco which for them is really a bonanza 

Typical political grandstanding and backroom payoffs at the expense of the people  Again

BC Health Minister Kevin Falcon is not telling the public the truth  British Columbia is not different than other provinces and is not in fact restricting the vaccine only to priority groups 

A colleague of mine here in BC went to his doctor's office and received moth the H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccine  He has no underlying medical conditions and is not in any priority group 

So it is untrue for Kevin Falcon to say that BC is prioritizing the vaccine  Individual doctor's offices and private clinics have been given large amounts of the vaccine and are distributing it to their patients on a first-come-first-serve basis 

The provincial health officer has also said that it is impoossible to properly screen people at flu clinics for underlying conditions  Clinic staff do not have the diagnostic tools to determine whether a person does have underlying medical conditions and are taking people at their word  No doctor's slip is needed 

So BC's flu strategy is in as much disarray as everywhere else  As usual Kevin Falcon is misleading the public about his government's approach which is deeply flawed

Here is a video that will open your eyes:

http://www brasschecktv com/page/731 html

and if you get flu symptoms like demand from you doctor to be tested in order to find out if you have the H1N1 flu  In a lot of cases it is something else and because it is your health you want to know in order to deal with the problem 
As you can see in the video a very little percentage of the people got it 
This is video was not generated by any conspiracy theorist it has Wall Street Journal and Politico reported by Washington Unplugged CNBC is a very normal media outlet 
So be prepared to ask your doctor for a test  CDC has developed one and we all should have easy access to a test that will give us answers not guesses

This mess is solely created by Stephen Harper  The provincial and the municipal governments shouldn't have to take the blame  Why? There is no shortgage of clinics to give the shots if there were enough vaccines  In some communities retired nurses have volunteered to come out and help with the immunization  There is also no shortage of people who want the shots  The problem is there are not enough vaccines to be given  Supplying the vaccines is the federal government's responsibility  It's all their fault  Yes some provinces like Alberta have tried and failed to immunize everybody at once  It may not be very smart but it is really hard to turn away people who want a shot when the Health Minister and the Chief Medical Officer are going on the media to urge people to  I call upon everybody to point their fingers at only one direction - at Stephen Harper

There has been so little news coverage in the G&M on Quebec's H1N1 flu vaccination status  I hear about all these cities with line-ups and in Montreal general vaccination has not even started (currently health-care workers are being vaccinated)  In Montreal in general the first clinics are opening Friday November 6th for kids 0-6 months and people with compromised immune systems  On Monday November 9th vaccinations start for kids 6mth-5yrs and pregnant women Nov 16 those 18 and under with chronic health issues Nov 23 those 18-65 with chronic health issues  Only starting December 7th will it be open to the rest 

Is this just a more organized plan? Quebec has received their share of the vaccine and I assume it is not used up like in other provinces and stockpiling it for the major inoculation (Note: Quebec has started to vaccinate more isolated areas of the province) 

I am just curious of the difference  Perhaps one will never know until all is over but is a more organized approach better to one of reaction? [that and where is this news coverage]

Also where is the news coverage if we Canadians are getting our money worth with our 10 year agreement (signed in 2001 with Shrire -- then sold to ID Biometrics which was then purchased by Glaxo)     an ~$320M deal  I believe in ~2005 another deal was signed (with Glaxo) to ensure enough supply for double doses for every Canadian 

Canada paid a big price up-front for just this situation  The question is: are we as promised getting first access to the H1N1 vaccine being produced by Glaxo in St-Foy? Did the federal recent decision to order non-adjunct virus effect the plan? Are we even behind on our pandemic plans or ahead (I believe the goal is to immunize all Canadians within 2 months) 

Any true journalists out there?

The vaccine is not stupid it is an important public health tool to prevent widespread illness  This flu is very virulent much more virulent than the regular flu for the simple reason that very few people are immune to it  That alone is a good reason to be vaccinated 

What is not coming through clearly in this article is the shockingly high hospitalization rate of the 0-5 age demographic something you NEVER see with regular seasonal flu 

Also not adequately explained in this article is that the majority of deaths from this flu (again a very large peak) is coming from the 50-60 year olds (the people most likely to have underlying health conditions in the younger population) again a population not affected in this way by a regular seasonal flu 

*FORTUNATELY* for most people the flu is proving to be relatively mild because the people who get a bad case of it *really* get a bad case and wind up with pneumonia in the ICU on a respirator  Neither the WHO nor any other health authority had any way of predicting whether it would be mild or not or if or when the virus will mutate  The Canadian winter is so long that we actually have 2 flu seasons so there is still a lot of time to go before we can declare an all clear 

And make no mistake about it the virus *can* still mutate and turn into something very deadly  (Better to have some vaccinated protection than none at all )

Unfortunately the media is not good at communicating these messages instead sensationalizing the story  And off course people like Dr  Richard Schabas who criticize public health officials for their level of preparation are irresponsible and only serve to undermine and confuse the messaging  Anyone who agrees with Dr  Schabas should take a long hard look at what went wrong in the preparation and response to Hurricane Katrina and then try to defend his position  I for one am glad that he is not in charge of the H1N1 preparations for Canada

More fear mongering as usual 

Why the mixed messages about the reliability of statistical analysis regarding death tolls versus infection rates?

I understand that there is no test being performed to determine that the specific infections are swine flu or not - so the whole analyis seems skewed to fit the fear mongering agenda  How many people have been infected by so called normal (but still deadly to kill)Flu?

On the ground level this is definitely not that much milder than the seasonal flu as those mortality stats would suggest  It's as bad if not worse as regular seasonal flu  That's the clinical experience 

But I thought according to this same article that:
Some health officials have questioned the intense government focus on H1N1 saying it is a mild virus that has killed fewer people than the seasonal flu  The seasonal flu kills about 4000 people each year and results in the hospitalization of tens of thousands more 


Hmmmmm  I smell a rat  Or a pharma industry bonanza  Or a bunch of bureaucrats covering their assess for wasting 1 5 billion dollars and   

But something smells anyway

R2G2: Typically viruses that are passed easily (ie  without a vector) evolve to become less virulent over time  The reason for this is that the advantage of rapid replication for the virus is outweighed by the fact that the victim is immobilized and thus tends not to spread the virus as much  Less virulent variants of the virus have a tendency to be propagated more readily because their victims continue to go to work go to school ride public transportation etcetera  There is an interesting literature on this  Of course in this case we have a virus that hasn't been in humans for very long and these are unpredictable  You are correct that it could mutate into something more consistently terrible but this is highly unlikely and if it occurred would not spread nearly as fast as a low virulence flu like the one causing panic around the world today  Simply put if people can't move around and there is no vector it can be more easily contained

You understand little and seize every opportunity to misconstrue  A report last weekend showed H1 has done what all other pandemics did pushed the seasonal flu out of existence in a phenomenon known as strain displacement (or something like displacement that I forgot)  Anyway the tests showed 99 7% of all flu this season is H1 so the seasonal vaccine is not worth getting

As more people get vaccinated fewer people will get sick which will free up resources in our overcrowded hospitals and clinics

Why call it the 'pandemic' virus when there is no pandemic  Please show chart comparing it to flus in other seasons  Please state overall death rates from other diseases during same time period for perspective  Why weren't flu deaths followed death for death over all other previous seasons like this one  Remember hysteria over bird flu which was gonna get us good if not this year the next   It's as if 'the media' wants a pandemic crisis to get ratings  My mother died on cancer in september  a few days later I heard that a friend of a close friendmuch younger died of cancer a day later and a few days later I got my hair done and the hairdressers mom had died of cancer at the same time  Is there a cancer pandemic  Likely The Media talks about 1917 flu alot without perspective  In those days it was fairly common to get a cold and die a week later pneumonia  We've been spared this over the century thanks to antibiotics but we're still 'wired' to fear germs say over global warming or lifestyle diseases that slowly kill us and own children while making big pharma richer

M Doe: Thanks for that little pro-Health Canada PR routine  I guess this is your new line now that we are all beginning to realise that this is less severe than the seasonal flu  According to your logic you will be able to declare victory when you can state that we 'caught this flu in its tracks before it mutated into something more serious!' The reality is that there was never much chance of this happening in the first place and you've just gone and jabbed hundreds of millions of people with squalene and mercury  So a few hundred thousand people or maybe a few million people will die of this this year just like with the seasonal flu each winter  In a decade or two people may well be wondering why there is such an unexplained increase in autoimmune disorders  Listen some diseases are very well worth the small immunization risk  Others are not  This is of the latter variety  I would encourage vaccination against minor illnesses like chicken pox and meningococcal illnesses before swine flu  Bah! This will be a forgotten side-note in a couple of years

The difference is that the regular seasonal flu kills people with underlying health conditions especially the elderly  With H1N1 it is not the elderly who are dying (at least not proportionally) but young healthy people  The flu is supposed to feel like death but it's not supposed to actually kill you if you're otherwise healthy  That's why this one is different

Just curious  If everyone in the country did decide that they wanted this shot exactly how long would it actually take to vaccinate everyone? In one small community of 110000 they are vaccinating at the rate of about 3300 a week for the past 3 weeks  Looks to me like it will take about 7-1/2 months to vaccinate everyone  I hope the person at the end of the line realizes it could be next June before they get their turn  Will we still have an H1N1 pandemic at that time?

You would think that most people would want to err on the side of caution and get the H1N1 shot  Since the medical community is split on the severity of the H1N1 waves why risk it  There is a larger risk and a larger consequence if you do get it and are in a vulnerable group 

I'm not sure what the vigorous objection is from the writers here 
Is it the cost? Are your taxes going up? Is it something to bash the government about (there's better fodder out there) Is it you are not in a vulnerable group?

And unfortunately if the shots do the job and work minimizing the impact of H1N1 deaths you'll only claim see - I told you so

to 'taxpayers'
The problem with the flu shot is the following:
a few weeks ago a study showed that people who gets the regular flu shoot has twice the chance to get the H1N1 so why take a chance and get the flu shoot when we have no idea of the long term effects? Thousands of people die every year of car accidents (about 2500 in Canada) and we still drive like maniacs

To all those whinging about how the vaccine should have been available to anyone who wants it by now    it takes time to make a vaccine  There isn't a factory filled with magic vaccine fairies producing vials of the stuff on demand  The provinces needed to deem how best to distribute what was available to the people who needed it the most 

If the media were truly responsible and balanced they'd offset the hysteria over H1N1 deaths by also reporting the mortality and morbidity statistics on regular seaonsonal flu 

The media are largely to blame for the hysteria over H1N1    it's not anthrax it's not smallpox it's not Ebola  It's a nasty flu  It's boring so the media needs to hype it for all it's worth

If this issue is so serious why is the vaccine not available in schools  You can't take these people seriously when they expect your family to wait in line for hours in a crowded space for a 15 second procedure

[Ottawa – November 12 2009] – More than half of Canadians say that the high level of public concern over H1N1 is “exaggerated”  Just one in ten thinks the level of public concern is “understated” 

Fourteen per cent of Canadians reported having already received the H1N1 inoculation in this survey  “This is actually a very large number – about 5 million when you extrapolate the findings to the broader population” said EKOS President Frank Graves

Plans to receive H1N1 vaccine 
¤ 33% absolutely certain
¤ 17% quite certain
¤ 24% not sure
¤ 26% will not

MY point  Then every flu season is a pandemic  That's why it's called flu season  I'm not against getting the vaccine  But why aren't my kids in university (high risk) getting it? Or being advised to get it in any way  etc  etc  Answer they aren't as important as hockey players: they don't generate money in the economy

zcrook thanks but I disagree the seasonal flu also kills a few 'healthy' people every year and the majority of H1N1 deaths have been people with underlying health issues 
 
I suggest the paranoia was driven by two things the WHO stating its a pandemic and the tragic death of the young man in ontario a couple of weeks ago 
 
But I find that death to be very odd (not that that reduces the tragedy) this kid had been to the Dr who said his lungs were clear his family said he seemed to be getting better and then he suddenly collapsed and died that's not the same pattern of most people who die of the flu who typically get pneumonia start to get organ shutdown and die from that

Freedom my opinion on the shot has never changed  And honestly I was a bit disappointed with the amount people that were scared into getting in line 

I'm still optimistic that most people will continue to see this as fear mongering  It seems like the media has dug in it's heels though willing to go as many waves as it needs to 

I just don't trust it  No other real reason I have to not get the shot than that  It's just my opinion though and I don't expect others to have the same opinion but at least lots of us have become quite critical of the media in this mass hysteria 

It just doesn't sit right with me

Frankly it's embarrassing that Canada had to buy into this numbers mumbo-jumbo  It's pretty obvious that it's driven by unconscionable greed and self-serving fear-mongering on the part of the public health establishment--which depends on crises real or imagined for its own survival and growth  Aside from that consideration the respected Globe & Mail should do an independent investigation into what companies are reaping the profits  Follow the dollar!

I would like to know why there are next to no cases in the North and the East  I think I may know the answer but people would call me the R word  Is it that the virus just didn't reach thouse areas?

What happen to Health Canada saying the 2nd wave would be light?

I do not understand why there is not enough vacine for those who want it  I am sure the company making the product is more the happy to make and sell the product  I am sure they can charge what ever price they want  Is that the problem the Canadian Gov't is not willing to pay

Ah yes but don't worry we'll all get the shots once the flu season is over so no problemo no problemo at all  Our federal government has taken care of everything  Sad really sad after all their don't worry we won't have any shortages bleating 

The second wave of the 1918 influenza was the worst at about 10 times the first (in terms of number of deaths) the last was less than the second but still about 3 times as worse than the first so one can't say don't worry it will die out by itself rather what happens is that lots of folks died from it and rest eventually built up immunities against it 

from wiki on the 1918 Spanish Flu:

It was caused by an unusually virulent and deadly influenza A virus strain of subtype H1N1  Historical and epidemiological data are inadequate to identify the geographic origin of the virus  Most of its victims were healthy young adults    which is a characteristic we also have been seeing in this version

There is no hysteria in the US? I'm currently living there and that's all I hear  I'm pretty certain its American media driving this one 
Additionally there is always concern with a new virus  I don't blame any health agency being over cautious had it exploded into a serious epidemic you would be on them too  Stop being the devils advocate 
The technology in developing the H1N1 vaccine is the same as the regular flu  No one seems too concerned about getting the regular vaccine every year even though it technically is a new drug each year

One thing about it no one is being forced to take the shot so why all the fuss? Just don't get one if you don't believe there is any danger in this flu  There has been a lot of fuss about Aids especially from the entertainment industry but in the grand scheme of things not many die of it  I'm far less concerned about getting Aids than I am the flu

Every time there is a 'crisis' you can hear a big 'sucking sound'  That's the sound of more of your income going to assist the government in tackling its latest beast!

In just a short amount of time the federal government has managed to $55B+ for a financial crisis $1 5B+ on a questionable 'pandemic' and god help us if our leaders are swindled into the ~trillion dollar cap-and-trade fiasco 

Consider this: our banknotes are 0 1092mm thick if you created a stack of $100 banknotes $55B high it would reach 60km high!! ( 1092mm x 550M $100 banknotes) Lay the stack down on the highway think about how far 60km is!! The government lives hand to mouth it has no money stashed away  Where does it get it? From taxes &/or more borrowing interest it owes comes from YOUR paychecks!! The middle class' paychecks!! If all that doesn't pi*s you off you are in need of an ambulance!

It's again revealing to see who's zooming who with sensationalist 'facts'  Like the WHO's redefinition of pandemic (broadening) when it dropped the widespread mortality clause 

It's being manipulated here and in the fountainhead Michael Fumento 'opinion'  The change was made six years ago and was never jigged special for H1N1/A 

The next sensationalist junk is this '4000' die each year from 'regular flu'  So what?

200 deaths and rising stress on the health system vaccine program falls apart cases rising and spreading  If it was a new virus called mamlurov and did this - it would be health issue 1  It has no respect for the winter bug season it's species-jumping with relative ease and it's taking down victims who should be the most likely to shrug it off

A guy died  Since he was a very bad person he was sent to hell 
Received by the devil himself he was given the chance of a tour in hell to choose his own punishment 
First the devil shows him a place where people were flogged daily than another place where people were all day hearing complains from their mother-in-laws  By the end of the day he had been shown all sorts of punishments  You name it  He was checking on this last one where people had to eat a plate of s##t everyday  Suddenly the devil’s cell phone rings  Meanwhilea guy who was nearby approaches the deceased and asks him if he is picking his hell  He confirms and the guy says:
¬– Pick this one! It is the best!
– The best?! Eating s##t everyday? I'm not quite sure   
You are Canadian aren’t you? Well do you remember the H1N1 vaccination program in Canada? Here it is the same thing  Either there is no s##t or there is no plate or yet the lines are so huge that you can't get it  In addition they work very few hours in a very limited number of distribution posts  When there is s##t it is not enough for everyone  Listen: I’m here for three months already and I haven’t had s#it yet!
Meanwhile 190 people are dead…and we can keep on counting

On November 3 2009 more than 170 researchers public health officials and health practitioners met at the University of Toronto Faculty Club for a conference on the 'Diagnosis and Treatment of Vitamin D Deficiency   This was the largest gathering of vitamin D researchers held in North America this year 

The field of vitamin D research is exploding with more than 3000 academic papers published this year alone including a placebo/ vitamin D study on the incidence of colds and flu that showed that vitamin D supplementation dramatically reduces the incidence of colds and flu  The highest incidence of colds and flu was in the placebo group during winter the very time when vitamin D levels are at their lowest  The lowest incidence of colds and flu in the placebo group (which was significantly higher than the vitamin D supplemented group) was in the summer when vitamin D levels are highest due to vitamin D generated in the skin through sun exposure  Journal of American Physicians and Surgeon Volume 14 Number 2 Summer 2009

No study has ever been done in which vaccines have been tested against a placebo 


As much as 97% of Canadians are deficient in vitamin D  Only about 3% know what their blood levels of vitamin D are 

The headline of the story on the vitamin D conference was 'Eradicate Breast Cancer With Vitamin D?'  If the story had been about a new drug it would have made the front page of every paper  Yet it got almost zero media coverage 

Our health care bureaucrats have known for years that there is a serious epidemic of vitamin D deficiency that is having an enormous impact on the health of Canadians  H1N1 pales in comparison  So how is it that not only have our health bureaucrats ignored this issue for years but labs in the Maritimes are no longer doing 25-OH-D blood tests for vitamin D and medical professionals in BC are under a directive to not order this test  There is a reason

The general public need to know that we have people working for us that know what they're doing 

I'm totally dumbfounded by this whole ordeal   and when I finally get the opportunity to roll up my sleeve I'm suppose to trust the very same buffoons that have made such a mess of everything   that the vaccine is okay

One thing that has not been made clear by the media or anyone else is that the seasonal flu death stats are ESTIMATES whereas (at least in Canada so far) the H1N1 death stats are lab-confirmed  And to be perfectly blunt after doing a LOT of investigation for the stats on seasonal flu death for my province of Alberta I have come to the conclusion that no one really has any hard data  We have all heard the oft-repeated 2000-4000-ish deaths from seasonal flu in Canada per year stat since Alberta has about 10% of the population a reasonable estimate would be 200-400 seasonal flu deaths per year  But if you go to the Alberta Health Services page and locate the Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 Response Plan report (blue button that'll open a pdf file) you'll find at the end of the second paragraph on page 7 the statement that Seasonal influenza results in about 17 deaths annually in Alberta    And then again a few days ago at a press conference Dr  Andre Corriveau (AB's main health official) said that seasonal flu has accounted for anywhere from 11 to 90 deaths per year in Alberta over the past number of years  Hmmmm    

Ok so according to the latest tally again found at the Alberta Health Services site Alberta has had 38 deaths (and 755 hospitalizations) as of Nov 13th from H1N1  So that 38 deaths is what? More than triple a low seasonal flu year of 11 deaths? More than double the 17 figure found in the Pandemic Response Plan report found on the same Alberta Health services website? Less than half the 90 of a bad seasonal flu year? But a small fraction of the expected 200-400 deaths from the oft-quoted Canadian death total estimate?

Makes it kinda difficult to say if this flu is more mild or more deadly than seasonal flu eh? Thanks for the context!

Excellent piece Caroline and Karen especially the graphic 

Comparing the seasonal flu with this new H1N1 variant is like comparing apples and oranges or more precisely like comparing every known variety of apple against an orange since what is called 'seasonal flu' is actually a group of more than 200 viruses that cause flu-like illness 

What distinguishes H1N1 from seasonal flu is its very high rate of spread and its proclivity for causing severe disease in the young especially in young individuals with underlying health conditions 

The story that may have been missed here is that influenza H1N1 included is usually not the immediate cause of death its complications such as viral pneumonia are 

Since effective and safe vaccines are now available for the common pneumonias would it not make better sense to vaccinate against it rather than a constantly changing pool of rhinoviruses? We would continue to get these bugs during the winter but the chances of us ending up in an intensive care unit would be greatly reduced 

So too would our costs of health care

Roger I agree overall with your apples and oranges point but two things:

1 - seasonal flu also kills (mainly the elderly) thru secondary infections like pneumonia--this is no doubt part of why it is so difficult to get hard data on flu deaths

2 - with H1N1 the pneumonia that is killing is viral pneumonia not bacterial and the pneumonia vaccine only protects against certain strains of bacterial pneumonia

Firstly a disease doesn't have to be fatal to be worth vaccinating against  After a month I'm still dealing with after-effects from my bout    and three of my coworkers have been off for nearly two weeks on short-term disability leave thanks to this flu  I also personally know two people hospitalised by H1N1 though fortunately only briefly  Some will experience this as a regular flu but even those such as myself who aren't in at risk categories could find it far more gruelling 

Secondly calling H1N1 mild is a relative comparison see first paragraph for my reasoning  It may be mild compared with other pandemic strains but it's still much nastier than the usual seasonal flu 

Thirdly those advocating quarantine over vaccination forget that the virus is communicable for roughly 24 hours before symptoms manifest    a gaping window for this very communical flu strain to get through a quarantine 

As a brother and uncle of people at risk I beg you to get vaccinated when you qualify  Please help limit the spread of this disease  (Plus take heed of my first-hand observations on this    you really don't want to catch it )

The H1N1 YES or NO vaccination conondrum in this forum and elsewere has reached a pandemic level and I think that's good - It highlights the democratic values of our society even in
cientific/health matters 

In spite of opinions on either side of the YES or NO sides of the debateeverybody agrees there is an health risk of H1N1 as low as it may be  Therefore it makes sence to have the vaccine 

Apart from that I believe we have allready committed the money for the vaccine and more importantly due to the high propagation characteristic of this virus we will increase the
rate the virus spreads if we don't take it 

So in my opinion is YES we should be immunized 

just my 2 cents

I am afraid it is the situation of not letting the virus jump into humans in the first place and everyone appears to miss this point completely  In the tropics and other areas of the world where the killer pandemic virus will no doubt emerge and where it is very cold through the night farmers sleep with pigs and chickens etc etc etc  Therefore as the animals especially pigs are incubators for most of the possible killer viruses the farmers are breathing in night-after-night a concoction of air borne viruses and mixing in the human lungs and throat tract  When man becomes infected with human flu the whole thing is mixing all together for 8 hours on average every night  This is one of the main reasons why avian and swine jump into man  Stop these simple things happening and the virus will have very little chance to spread into humans – you need very close contact for the initial killer virus to become infected into humans in this respect  After that the person infected can easily transmit via chough sneezes etc etc to other unsuspecting humans  It is therefore the initial stages that are so vital  The only element therefore needed in many ways is that we give these millions and millions of farmers cheap heaters to keep them and their families warm throughout the cold nights  Then they would not sleep with the pigs chickens et al  Indeed you take the source away from the jump into humans (nightly incubation that goes on every night) and if people know anything about these viruses they will know that they need a mixing vessel where all three viruses exist together  Vaccination of the livestock is also one of the other preventative measures  Put these two together plus other simple methods and the virus can hardly jump or exist in humans as it has not the incubation period to do so – the innovation chain is broken  Indeed the transmission is extremely low if at all – as the problem is eradicated at source and it never happens

But again because there are not billions in profits for this field work for pharmaceutical corporations no one wishes to listen not even politicians as the drug’s lobby group is so powerful that it strikes all other alternatives down – even if they are the true solution to the problem  It is estimated that all these preventative methods would cost around £50 billion to put in place and which is a very small price to prevent the hundreds of millions that will die once the real killer virus does raise its ugly head (as it will some day) and the financial costs and damage economically to the world are vast far  far more than £50 billion as the whole system could well collapse 

You will never quicken the lead-time quick enough for any antidote even if we had an antidote that was safe within 1-month  The reason the logistics in manufacturing and then distribution would take at least 6 months in the quantities needed (billions of doses) to get to the very first few  For if people did not know also the 1918 Spanish flu that killed between 20 and 100 million did its worst in the first 6-months of the start of the outbreak  Indeed from week 16 /> Week 26  We have been lucky in the near past that the virus have not been easily transmitted to humans  But when the killer virus does appear that can easily jump into humans the drugs strategy will be absolutely useless  People should therefore really use their common sense here for their family’s and loved one’s sake and see clearly that this drugs strategy has not a cat in hell’s chance of working when the thing is with us  Then it will definitely be too late for hundreds of millions of people who will inevitably die – it may even be over 1–billion deaths as some people estimate

I finish by quoting the old adage that 'Prevention is better than cure and where this has always been the primary consideration of health professionals  This has to be the hallmark statement also to stop the eventual killer virus happening  Why treat the condition when you should never let it start 
Unfortunately we have thrown this well established and primary medical understanding of human health out of the window

Dr Hill

I appreciate your explanation of how viruses jump from animals to humans and the conditions that faciliate this to happen 
I agree that prevention is no doubt the best way to avoid viruses to afect humans but I think that your proposed solution that of providing heaters to avoid prolonged human contact with animals is naive and unrealistic 
You are analyzing the problem from a developed country perspective and not taking into consideration the conditions where this happens 

As you said The only element therefore needed in many ways is that we give these millions and millions of farmers cheap heaters to keep them and their families warm throughout the cold nights  This is completely unviable - We give them heaters what kind of heaters? what form of energy will they use? etc etc etc

Many if not most of the farmers in Africa and Asia are on a survival mode and even if we would give them the heaters they wouldn't probably use them anyway 

What we the developed world need to do is to invest in better education and better economic conditions of the poor countries so that the prevention of transmission of viruses and other problems can be resolved or become less acute

My knowledgeable friends have over the months sent information plus my own research into the Novel A H1N1 flu viruses and the vaccines composition 
The hype over this is fear engendering and I believe this flu currently is mild  What will come perhaps will be far worse if one reads about the Ukraine multi ill and the chem trails  But people don't question - however if 40% are refusing the vaccine shot or the tamiflu - perhaps they are wiser then naught  1 5 billion - I wonder who the major shareholders are of the pharmaceutical company are? And I question to this day the UK scientists traveling to the arctic in the early 1990's to resurrect the spanish flu virus off the dead

As a person living in Ontario it seems Alberta is adjusting its plan to match changing circumstances  Here in Toronto total chaos reigns  The whole delivery is based on trust that people will honestly self identify as being at high risk   right that's quite a plan  Absolutely pathetic  Maybe when this is over they can consider looking at apprenticing to run a lemon aid stand 

The more anecdotal information I have obtained from friends and family the more I realize Toronto has been and continues to fly blind

U S  sees 10 million more H1N1 vaccine doses next week
Sat Oct 31 2009 2:37pm EDT
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Five drug companies are now increasing production of the vaccine for the H1N1 swine flu and 10 million more doses are expected next week Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said on Saturday 

President Barack Obama on Friday expressed frustration about the slow pace of production of the vaccine which has resulted in just 26 6 million doses as of Friday far below earlier estimates of 40 million by the end of October 

--------------------------

in US there are 5 drug companies making the vaccine  In Canada we have barely 1  Nice job guys

con hack PM:

What? Did you even read this article? Have you read or heard anything about this vaccine in the last week?
The Federal Government (that's Federal not provincial) has been given only a fraction of the innoculant that was promised by the company contracted to provide it to the country  As such fewer doses were provided to the provinces  Ontario recieved so few dosees they are in a crisis situation  And they are only immunizing high risk groups  Every province is only immunizing high risk groups 
Alberta looked at the promised delivery schedule and said 'I think we can help everybody'  Promises were broken  Not by 'unsteady Eddie' but by a federally contracted corporation  The only thing the alberta legislature did wrong (in this rare instance) was trust that you idiots could keep your panic in check long enough that people who may actually develop complications could protect themselves  This is a problem not created by the government but by the people  Frantic cowards and fear-mongers alike 

Re-read this  Where was privatization mentioned?

We can directly pin blame of this H1N1 vaccination fiasco on the doorstep of Stephen Harper and his merry band of neocons 

The fallout from Harper and his reformer’s gross incompetence just keeps growing and GROWING            and yet polls are suggesting that apparently the Harper neocons would obtain majority if an election took place today 

I don't know about any other rational thinkers out there but somehow that just does not add-up  With Harper’s government so blatantly incompetent yet supposedly they could obtain a majority support?

Something smells very fishy here folks      Harper appears to be a master manipulator of so many things such as: Parliamentary democracy The Bank of Canada The Governor General of Canada CSIS the RCMP most Provinces most religious right evangelicals and the media  Perhaps he has mastered being able to manipulate the polling company executives          I guess he really does get by “with a little help from his friends” 

The disturbing thing is that he seems to be using his skill of manipulation in a most devious and almost sinister way! If Canadians don't start to wake-up we're going to end up in the future going down a horrible path a path much worse than what the US has been experiencing in the last few years following the fallout from Harper’s hero GW Bush’s ultra right ideologies !

Wakie Wakie ! We need to push the Harper neocons out NOW    this must happen soon !

From Day 1 of the H1N1 vaccinations in Alberta it has been a gong show 

First Uncle Eddie told Albertans it was their civic duty to get the flu shot  To Alberta Health's surprise the few clinics that were open were swamped with 4-6 hour long lineups  And at some of these clinics people had to stand for hours in the outside cold 

After listening to the frustrated public Ron Liepert said he's sorry and opened up 11 more venues two days later  Now all of the sudden we're told the H1N1 vaccine clinics will be closed except for high-risk groups!

Who's in charge here? I blame Ron Liepert Uncle Eddie and their new health super board 

Just imagine if there was a full-blown epidemic? Scary!

This latest approach is what was needed on day 2 once we realized that the non targeted group was not waiting  In fact if the plan did not call for this originally then that was wrong as well  Regardlesss of when the vaccination was available the distribution plans should have been made months ago  The plan was a complete muck up 
This is the Health Authorities fault

The government mandated process assumed that by simply asking certain groups to wait that they would  One has to realize that in a government culture of non-accountability actual outcome (realities) do not matter until after the fact  It's hard enough for them just to put a committee together to come with any sort of process  You see since there is no accountability processes are never re-used or shared  Are ten people in a room the way to come with a process or is it more effective for one person to Google it and pick the best of all the processes that have been developed? See for yourself: Google on the words vaccine triage and to get started simply pick the first hit  If you know how to Google you would be a valuable asset to government and/or the various non-profit organizations it funds

Passing blame around the provinces for how the immunization was implemented is just closing the barn door after the horse has already left 

The real blame lies squarely with Stephen Harper and the Federal Progressive Conservative Party for cheaping out and not erring on the side of caution and ensuring that an abundance of vaccine was available in the first place

I think there will be cause to attempt other mass immunizations in the near future  If nothing else we have learned from this experience that our priorities should lie in being prepared to cope with the extraordinary demands that health care emergencies such as this one place on our weakened healthcare infrastructure 
Only a few of us will die this time as this is probably a fairly minor emergency - but there likely will be other more severe emergencies in the future  We ought to be preparing for this eventuality by increasing hospital staff and beds  We need to shore up public health departments so that they are more able to cope with extraordinary demands  We need to re-examine the wisdom of fifteen years of health care infrastructure cuts which have absolutely decimated our ability to handle even small emergencies like this H1N1 pandemic

As much as I dislike Harper and feel he is not in the interest of Canadians one can not blame him for a shortage of vaccine due to slowed production processes at the company that makes the vaccine  Harper ordered the proper amount and on time  The manufacturer can only do so much  It's not really anyone's fault  Sometimes there is only so much that can be done  Blaming Harper for this reduces valid arguements that Harper is an unfit PM

My wife and I waited six hours to get the vaccination in Alberta  The line up was long the people were very friendlythe little kids very well behaved the health workers very pleasent  So if the serum providers cannot manufacture the product as fast as it is being used why blame the government any government  Remember Health Canada was providing production forecasts that came from the supplier  If anyone here thinks they could have done any better how about an explanation? Seems to me everyone that has a gripe blames the government  The anti- vaccination people blame the government for coming up with something that is in their word dangerous and not required  The pro-vaccination folks blame the government because the supplier cannot provide enough product even though they said they could  Blame blame blame  Why not take a realistic look at the situation and take all preventative measures you can and hang in there

I received my seasonal flu shot 2 weeks ago and was told that the H1N1 flu vaccinations would be available in my region in early November  In fact I was a bit surprised that H1N1 vaccinations were already in process 

Some people here seem to be holding government to some kind of absolute standard of perfection  Its government for heavens sake!!

That said Ron Liebert is probably the last person who should be in charge of health care in this province  He is now blaming Albertans for following the governments confusing communications on getting the H1N1 vaccination  The government is in the process of its never-ending revamp of the health care system but not informing the public of its plans  Just watch me  is the operative moto of the government  Well the confusion surrounding the vaccination program doesn't provide much confidence in their getting any changes to the health care system right

You point out the media reports that the US has 5 H1N1 vaccine-producing pharmceutical companies while Canada s/b ashamed that it has only one 

The US is 10X the population of Canada  So either the US should have 10 producers (not just 5) or the Canadian producer GlaxoSmithKline ought to be doing only half a production shift to give Canada an equal pace of production 

The recipe for H1N1 was created as fast as possible by the pharmaceutical industry: it was produced ASAP & as we sit the US has about 27 million doses available  On a per capita basis that covers about 9% of the US population of 300+ million people 

Canada's pace of production is at least that fast if not twice as fast  US Senator Joe lieberman was on TV last week complaining that Canada is getting to use all of its home-grown production by US subsidiary GlaxoSmithKline 

So the Liberal accusations of foot-dragging by the Conservative Government's Health Ministry are just more bogus politicking by a desperate Liberal opposition

Other than that all is being done that can be done by the various actors

Here we go again  Another hyper divisive article on the bad private system that has existed for a long time in Canada 

Instead of blasting the private system one should ask why it exists in the first place  It exists because the pubic system has failed in many areas from access to doctors or to any other specialty such as 'ears nose throat' or endoscopy evaluations or surgeries  whatever 

The public system caps earnings of doctors which forces them to look elsewhere for income  Ask your local GP:

From the govt  of Canada site:

 Although it seems strange at first glance the annual employment income ($139681) of the 38% of members of this occupation who worked full time full year in 2005 was slightly lower than that of the 53% of those who worked full time but fewer than 49 weeks per year ($140144)  This phenomenon can be explained by the way the salary cap works: specialist physicians who quickly reach the salary cap tend to stop working at that point so they work fewer weeks per year than those who do not reach the cap but their income is higher 

http://www servicecanada gc ca/eng/qc/job_futures/statistics/3112 shtml

Then there is the expenses!

And before the several start bashing the rich the rich pay the majority of taxes in Canada that fund the public system  If they opt out of the public system that usually allows shorter wait lines in the public system 

Unfortunately the media and left leaning politicians and people do not want to have an adult conversation about how a mix of public and private can actually help the public system 

The preconceived negative and not totally informed ideas and emotions don't allow for it

As for the Private/public debate there are 2 pending BC Court cases that may decide the issue 

In Quebec it has ALREADY been decided by the Choulli case  Private is legal 

 the landmark Chaoulli case in Quebec in 2005 which ruled in a 4-3 decision that a ban in that province on private health insurance violated the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms 

Only a minority of the justices in the Chaoulli case agreed that the ban violated the Canadian Charter as well  The Chaoulli ruling currently is binding only in Quebec

Private clinics exist because some people are misguided enough to believe that because they earn more money than others they should also be able to buy better health care  Their's is not a social conscience as some would have us believe 

In my opinion it speaks to a person's character when a rich healthy man believes he has the right to get protected against H1N1 before a truly at-risk pregnant mom-to-be  He is nothing more than a self-centered coward in my opinion a person who does not have the spine to speak publicly about what he did

we also note highly agitated medical officials absolutely unable to cope with the public chaos and hysteria so carelessly created by the government 'information' campaign 

only one word sticks in relation to this government debacle   'incompetence'

I don't see anything wrong with being able to pay to jump a queue  If anything it just incentives public health care to shorten the queue and speed up  While they are scratching their heads we would be going without where it not for other options 

People who fear two tier are only bitter that some may get better care  Well they are not on your dime when they are doing it so tough  In Ireland and UK it works well  I don't see why we can't have it in Canada 

Besides we already have two tier  Just fly to the US

Parallel private health care has existed in this country for some time  If you can afford it and you need some quick attention you go south and book into an American facility  These are dollars that are leaving the country  We can also find some of our best Canadian trained nurses and dooctors in these facilities  We could stop this brain and money drain with a few clinics and with our (Usually) lower dollar perhaps get some money flowing back North

Just to incense the anti-private clinic crowd a bit more they should know that among the biggest users of private clinics are the RCMP federal prison guards and provincial Workers Compensation Boards  These government agencies and institutions purchase private medical services in order to shorten the recovery time for for ill or injured staff and/or clients  By by-passing the public system they get the services they need on a timely basis - no wait times at all in some cases 

So clamour all you want but government is not likely going to change a system that works very well for its own employees and the WBCs

The people who have pointed out that the Canadian healthcare system is already well on its way to becoming a two-tiered system are right  It's one of the most notable illustrations of the Conservative penchant for legislating by stealth  Harper knows that he would never be able to openly dismantle Canada's beloved public healthcare system so he achieves the same thing by simply failing to protect it  This H1N1 crisis is a perfect case in point  In what is clearly a national emergency the national government stands back and does nothing 

Ms  Aglukkaq said it is up to the provinces to determine how they distribute the vaccine 

Talk about a lack of leadership!

Meanwhile in a country whose citizens still have some backbone and don't run to the doctor for drugs at the first sign of a sniffle a real pandemic (not WHO's phony reworking of the term) is developing 

In Ukraine over 200000 people have reportedly been struck within the past two weeks by a mystery flu-like illness whose varied symptoms suggest anything from Ebola to pneumonic plague to typhus to bird flu to mutated swine flu  Corpses are piling up (sixty within one week) including those of doctors  Some Ukrainian locals are calling it the Baxter flu in reference to Baxter's notorious attempt to lace seasonal flu vaccines with the highly lethal bird flu virus 

In response to this real health emergency (as opposed to the contrived one in Canada) Ukraine has gone into lock-down  Not surprisiingly there is a TOTAL BLACKOUT about this in the heavily-controlled Western mainstream media  Considering that Canada has the world's highest concentration of Ukrainians (behind Ukraine itself and Russia) you'd think the press here would have reported such a serious outbreak 

Nevertheless here are a couple of links  Thank God for the internet

Further to my post of 6:59 a m  regarding the pneumonic plague-like outbreak in Ukraine:

In August a bizarre story emerged on the internet  The news was full of reports of (http://www huffingtonpost com/2009/08/14/man-suspected-of-making-t_n_259330 html) a man named Joseph Moshe who was arrested after an hours-long standoff with the police because he had supposedly made threats against the White House  The man was able to withstand multiple rounds of tear gas    which left L A  police officers amazed 

However the internet community was very skeptical of the true reasons behind the man's arrest  Comments on the Huffington Post website immediately began pouring in about an unreported side to this story namely that Joseph Moshe was a Mossad Agent who specialized in biological warfare and who just prior to his arrest had called into a radio show to warn people about a biological weapn that was being made by Baxter International that would be spread through vaccine and would cause a plague upon its release 

Although anyone can make a doomsday claim and we should never believe anyone (and it must be said that the Truth movement handled this well the message was spread without being proclaimed as gospel) the amazing part about Moshe's claim was the location where Moshe said the biological weapon was being produced 

Moshe claimed that Baxter's laboratory in the Ukraine out of all places was creating this biological weapon  All of this came out in the beginning of August which is more than two months before the situation that is currently unfolding  For Moshe to correctly name the country where a new epidemic would be unleashed requires either inside information or an incredible coincidence as anyone with a basic knowledge of statistics can confirm for himself

If you think healthcare is expensive just wait until you see what it costs when it is free 

I wonder sometimes if we had the scenario where all healthcare services were provided by the free market instead of government where costs tend to rise and quality tends to fall 

The mainstream media cartel has been trying to whip us into a frenzy about H1N1 since April  Now that the vaccine is available we see long lines shortages and government officials claiming OMFG! We are SO surprised about the demand! and the apologies vowing reviews are sophistries leading nowhere 

Consider the public reaction if free market healthcare services failed to meet the demand  People lobotimized by government provided education would jump up and exclaim OMFG! Those free marketeers can't deliver the vaccine to us! The greedy are just trying to make a profit! We need to socialize medicine now so we don't have to wait in long lines and suffer shortages! How's that all working out?

If medical care is so important to Canadians to be enshrined as a human right why not food? a house? a car? a job?  We all agree healthcare is important but food is equally important - if not more so - to survival why not agree that government should monopolize food production (farms) and distribution (grocery stores)?

There was a old joke that circulated in Cold War U S S R that went something like this:
Two old women were standing in line waiting for their weekly ration of bread  One woman says to the other I am so tired of standing in line for my food! It feels like I have been waiting half my life in lines!

The other turns to her and says to her in shock You should count your blessings  Over in America the government doesn't even distribute food!

Government is a disease masquerading as its own cure

Whether it's a quick flight to the US for treatment or a private clinic in Canada these options are not going away so let's drop the hysterics and have an honest look at two-tier which many other peer nations have used successfully

The hysteria and fear of private clinics is as loony as the mob rush for a shot  Perhaps the Globe's writer should have checked Medcan's emailed notices to its members first  The only ones getting shots are those who would qualify anywhere else based on their risk profile  Members may want shots but they aren't getting preferential treatment  So if someone wants to pay a fee to get a shot they could get for free somewhere else and in doing so frees up medical staff at the other end     exactly what is wrong with that?

I have no problem with private clinics if they were operating as tuly private  But this is not how they work they bill the province ie OHIP  So they are receiving public monies as well as private  This exclusivity does create a two teired system that draws from public funds 

It is not like your family doctor where they are restricted by OHIP here in Ontario and only get what OHIP schedules allow  Most family doctors cannot afford the additional staff to administer the H1N1 so are left to opt out 

The private clinics bill both OHIP and the patient through fees so they can offer this shot  Definately two teired and definately means that regular Joe Blows have less access  If private clinics had to doit entirely on their dime I would agree but that's not how it's working

Right  Everyone knows that private enterprise does things more efficiently and cheaply than governments  That's why healthcare in the U S  costs twice as much per capita as healthcare in Canada despite the fact that 40% of the population isn't covered  It's also why Canada has better health outcomes leading to a higher life expectancy and a lower mortality rate

From what I hear Medcan is only giving the shot to those in the priority group    doctors are giving it to anyone  I've even heard of pediatricians giving the shot to the parents of their patients  I'd say that is much worse than a private clinic giving the shot to those who are in the priority group

I guess with a bit of extra money and less bureaucracy the roll out works  Rather then spend $$ evaluating where the govt process came short they are now going to spend CDN tax dollars trying to pick apart something that does  It is total c@#p  Focus on improving yourselves and don't fix what isn't broken

FYI for all those that love to blast the private system you are now witnessing the value that your governing and guardian place on your life  They will throw you under the bus at the first sign of trouble and this is a perfect case in hand  Want the names of Medcan patients?

These clinics should be shut down  If scalping sports' tickets is illegal so should scalping vaccines 

If I could not obtain a potentially life-saving vaccine by begging it from government only to be told I cannot have it in a timely fashion or at all are you telling me you are calling for violence to be initiated by a third party (government) to shut down all alternative access routes I might have to get it?

Are you telling me that you would hide behind government to prevent me - by force or legislation - from accessing a service that would save my life (or someone close to me)?

Tell you what  Why don't you stand in the doorway of one of these clinics and try and initiate violence against me for trying to obtain it  I promise you it will end very bad","

Most Canadians don't seem to differentiate between publicly funded health care and publicly provided health care  Indeed most physicians and clinics in Canada are private enterprises  The issue that perhaps irks those waiting for fair distribution of vaccines is that there are private clinics that offer enhanced services for a fee -- effectively charging for access to a physician  These clinics are now under pressure from their paying clients to provide something they should not provide which is a queue-jumping opportunity for non-priority patients to receive vaccine 

As much as I dislike what these clinics represent there is no legal (or moral for that matter) argument that they should not receive vaccines like any other clinics for their high priority patients  Those claiming these clinics are in contravention of the Canada Health Act might want to review a court ruling over such clinics in Quebec which effectively said a Canadian in need of health care cannot be held hostage to the fact that the government underfunds publicly provided services in health care like MRIs

Tax me I'm Canadian: Ding ding! We have a winner! Good post Dr  G !

In case it wasn't clear I think the drafters of the Canadian Charter got it exactly right  Anyone who thinks that freedom not to contribute their fair share to collective needs is more important than the health of their fellow citizens is a miserable human being 

------

I completely agree with you  Now let's go over a few thoughts 

Define fair share  What's fair? Who decides? Am I free to disagree? Am I free to act on my disagreement without violence being initiated against me by you or a third party (government)?

Is sharing supposed to be a coerced act or a voluntary one? Is taxation sharing? Is taxation theft?

Do you agree with the statement from each according to their ability to each according to their needs ?

I give to charity despite government removing money from my pocket by threat of force  Last year I donated $1500 to a charity organization to buy a stable of farm animals for a family  No force/coercion was employed for me to do so 

Do you think charitable organizations would disappear if government ceased operations? Would you be more or less inclined to donate to a particular charity if you had (a) more money in your pocket and/or (b) government did not have a specific program in place to target the same needs the charity covered? Do most of us flip our tax-returns back to the government thinking our duty to humanity is done? Such is the soul-killing logic of coerced collective sharing conflated into the word taxation 

We collectively employ each other  Each time we buy a good or service we contribute to the overall welfare of the sellers who in turn buy from others and so forth  No man is an island nor have I ever said so  We are each inter-dependant on each other  Should that be by way of force or voluntary action?

The problem here is the lack of foresight and planning  I suppose I could assume that the giveaways to private clinics were authorized after the lines became apparent and before shortages did but that could be just me being optimistic 

I think that the vaccine should only have been given out on the grounds that the clinics not restrict access to their customers  (As they have since voluntarily decided to do according to their statement) If they required compensation for that they should have been compensated for distribution by the public health authority 

Mind you the shortages make that moot their help is not required as it turns out

The outrage should be focused on the misleading headline  Since the clinics are giving the shot just like any other GPs office and even opening their doors to the general public they should be a welcomed part of the solution not made to look like they are doing something wrong  The article is balanced but the headline writer should be fired

There are lot of other family doctors who received the vaccine who are giving it to their patients according to the risk priority  Why is Medcan being singled out? They are like any family doctor except you pay  Any treatment is still done through ohip at ohip rates just like your own doctor  If some people want to pay because they feel like their getting special treatment let them pay

How can people blame the public system for the vaccine shortfall when GSK can't live up to its delivery promise? Even if you take into consideration the decision to switch to non-adjuvanted vaccine GSK promised more vaccine than it can apparently deliver 

Furthermore what is the justification for distributing the vaccine to these private clinics when workplace clinics were not allowed to receive it?

The Liberals have succeeded in creating a paranoia and a stampede by Canadians for the vaccine with unfounded fear mongering of shortages and delays  There is not one scintilla of evidence that GlaxoSmithKline has not acted quickly responsibly and expeditiously and as rapidly and thoroughly as humanly possible keeping in mind the safety of Canadians who are to receive the vaccine  In fact the opposite is true and our supplier is rated number one in the world in not only getting the vaccine out quickly and safely but also number one in getting more of it out on a per capita basis than in any other country in the world  As Dr  David Butler - Jones so aptly put it how much better than number one do you want us to be  We were told in September that the vaccine would be available in mid November so the fact that some was available and administered in October is actually exceeding expectations

Family doctors in BC and Ontario are receiving doses of the vaccine presumably for their patients only  This in itself is the perpetuation of a two-tier system  The growing number of Canadians without a family doctor cannot access any of the publicly-funded vaccines distributed to doctor's offices  It's hard to get angry that some vaccines are being distributed to private clinics that exclude those who cannot pay the fees when vaccines are also being distributed to doctor's offices that exclude those not fortunate enough to be on their list of patients 

As my family recently lost our family doctor because she moved to another community and there are no walk-in clinics in our town our only access to medical care is the emergency room  Try getting routine health care like the monotoring of an ongoing issue or regular diagnostic tests like exams or pap tests at the emergency room of your local hospital and you'll get a taste of what it's like to be unable to access a basic level of healthcare in Canada  My dog has better access to healthcare than my children

This is a bit of a straw man debate    the private clinics have ordered supply like any GP has  There are no vehicles to refuse to give them an order that they place    THAT said the province does have the right to ensure that the supply is going to the priority groups of their patient lists first     Ontario has said they were investigating to ensure they were indeed following the same protocol as any other doctor     so I think someone has jumped the gun here    yes there could be an issue but it doesn't seem to be happening yet 

THAT said I think the media makes too much of this sometimes or doesn't know how to prioritize what they are going to focus on      yes the opposition has mentioned this but this is not the biggest longest or loudest things they have been complaining about

Boy Rushed To Hospital After Swine Flu Jab

- - - - - -

This news was from Tuesday October 27th  By Wednesday according to Dr  Arlene King Ontario started hearing from the Federal counterparts that Ontario may receive fewer doses  By Thursday night according to Dr  Butler-Jones GSK told the federal government about the drop from 2 million a week to 436000 doses for this week 

Now the Belfast news may have nothing to do with the GSK drop in production  But then it would be reasonable to expect the federal government to seek information from the U K  about the serious adverse reaction of the boy in Northern Ireland  The normal government behavior would be to divert attention to some other cause but temporarily suspend production of the adjuvanted vaccine if the Northern Ireland case were considered to be serious enough  This normal reaction is government hedging the bets 

But then there may be zero correlation between the current chaos and the case in the U K

Sophie I agree   You should be able to go to your Dr to get the shot   If you live in Ont  you can't go to your Dr's office because the Ministry of health doesn't want to pay $120 a shot at a dr's office  

In a clinic its much cheaper  

I guess in Ont  they spent it all on consultants  

- - - - -

I am not defending the Ontario government  But what you said is deceptive  Doctors are saying they don't want to do it because of the packaging of the adjuvanted vaccine and the complicated waiver forms they have to explain to patients as well as processing them  The family doctor practices are not equipped to handle that 

They have to mix 2 vials one with adjuvant one with antigen to create 1 vial of 10 doses that need to be used up within 24 hours  Which means they have to set up times for flu clinics with appointments and unless you are a brand new doctor with no patients you simply don't have the time to work this way because you will have to cancel or postpone other appointments  An unadjuvanted vaccine would be 1 dose in a vial and you won't have to handle the extra paper work  Some doctors are also reluctant to be involved because they are aware that the vaccine is not adequately tested 

As far as the money is concerned what GSK and the Federal government tried to save with adjuvanted vaccine ended up costing Provinces and Territories more in logistics administration as well as lost productivity for the public 

The current order of 50 million doses adjuvanted and 2 million unadjuvanted should be changed to 26 million adjuvanted and 8 million unadjuvanted doses - total 34 million doses 

At the end of the day there is only ONE TAX PAYER 

We shouldn't be spending more of our money just to let GSK make more

I don't remember how much exactly was the price of the adjuvanted vaccine from GSK  I think it was some thing like 400 million dollars for 50 million doses or about $8 per dose  Even if the price of the unadjuvanted vaccine is doubled it is still cheaper to tax payers if you add the costs of logistics administration and extra time for doctors and nurses  These additional costs are most likely to be higher than $8 per dose  So not only is the adjuvanted vaccine more risky it is also more expensive 

If Canada didn't allow GSK to donate 20% of production capacity nor to export antigen until Canadian needs are met and we made only unadjuvanted vaccine the vaccine would have started delivery at least one month ago  GSK claimed that they were to start shipping bulk antigen (presumably to the U S ) starting September  I don't know whether that happened  If it did I would be quite upset

One other may not be so minor technicality  It is one thing to administer out of the same vial 10 doses of adjuvanted vaccine with a continuous flow of recipients in a public health flu clinic setting  It is quite another to do this in a family doctor setting  Imagine taking one dose at a time our of the same vial not continuously but intermittently because the flu shot appointments are not continuous - that's not the only job of the family doctor  Among other things it increases the chance of mistakes  The doctor will need an assistant to deal with the logistics and administration  Most doctors offices don't have that resource

I am sorry at the end the day it's a trickle down effect we are seeing from the top  The opposition (mostly the Liberals) have been complaining for months that the roll-out for the provinces was going to be an issue from staffing to procedures   there was going to be an issue  The Health Minister refused to acknowledge their criticism or advice in the matter and has fed us 'canned' statements for months now about how prepared they were and how everything was secured     there is little surprise that provinces are struggling when the information and direction from the feds has been so last minute and so disorganized

The entire flu vaccine program is a farce  A colleague of mine at work -- not in any of the priority categories -- went to his doctor for a scheduled visit  His doctor told him 'why don't we just give you the vaccines while you're here' and he received both the H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccine 

Meanwhile children pregnant women and asthmatic patients queue up for hours and are turned away  Absolutely reprehensible 

There were news reports months ago that Glaxo-Smith Klein could not or would not deliver the quantity of vaccine on the schedule laid out by the government because they have only one production facility with a limited capacity 

However the Harper governmnt did absolutely nothing to make sure the vaccine was produced on time  They could have demanded that GSK contract part of the production to another production facility but did not  They could have made sure that the company that won contract to produce the vaccine had the capacity to produce it on time  But they did not 

Meanwhile the Harper government was busy spending tens of million more in ads promoting the stiimulus spending than in education around the H1N1 vaccine leaving a vast knowledge gap in the minds of most Canadians 

It is time Canada's Health Minister resigned  It is time that the Harper government starteed thinking more about Canadians' interests than their own prurient lust for power

While I don't support private clinics I think these instances of private clinics in BC and Ontario getting the H1N1 vaccines initially were based on the Feds telling the Provinces there were abundant supplies of the adjuvanted vaccine  Although there was a plan to give injections only to those in high risk groups it was opened up to all on the first day in both Toronto and Alberta (at least)  This indicates that jurisdictions may have given guidance from the Feds that they want the clinics to be crammed 

As posted above smaller family doctor practices have challenges to handle the immunization with adjuvanted vaccine which not only must be used 10 doses at a time but are shipped 500 doses in a shoe box  This made it impractical to ask the provinces to distribute to small family doctor practices who are reluctant to handle the complicated logistics 

The answer is to give small family doctor practices the unadjuvanted vaccine which comes packaged as 1 dose 1 vial and does not require the explanation of complicated waiver forms nor ongoing monitoring after injection 

There is no reason to make 50 million adjuvanted vaccines  6 million more doses of unadjuvanted vaccines can be made if the order is reduced to 26 million doses of adjuvanted vaccines 

Now that GSK is converting to making unadjuvanted vaccine it makes sense to run this line a little longer to encourage more small family doctor practices to sign up

If the vaccine is free to said private clinics why are they getting the vaccine for free to earn a profit off a product the taxpayer bought? At the very least they should have to pay top dollar for the vaccine  Welcome to rationed healthcare Canada the left spend so much time bragging about socialized medicine but now they are screaming in rage because they can't get the vaccine now at this minute  Hello welcome to rationed healthcare the left doesn't like rationed healthcare if it effects the elites

spke says Forget the elderly and sick  Rich men first  It's health care Harper style 

Hey stupid     Health care is a provincial responsibility 

As for the whining the truth is that in order to get the job done efficiently the vaccine should be provided to any outlet public or private that has the ability and the technical training to administer the vaccine 

To play the two tier or public/private card is so typical of the radical left  They would much rather see huge lines (sort of like was common in Russia when people lined up at butcher shops etc  to get their ration of meat) than see an efficient method of distribution of the vaccine  Brain dead union mentality

I do not have to pay an annual fee to see my doctor where as to be part of a private clinic you do  Therefore the clinic which is making money off their doctors patients should have to pay for the vaccine 
Simply put if you want to make money over and above what the govt health system pays then you have to pay for the medications that you supply to patients

As for paying for the vaccine the ethical situation spiraled out of control when the government decided to inoculate the olympic athletes  Why does an athlete get a shot over someone in the high risk group? By the way many of those people you see in line on TV waiting for the flu shot are not part of the highest risk group but they got heir shot anyway  So ethics have been thrown right out the window at all levels not just these private clinics  Trying to impose an ethical high ground at this point is putting the horse before the cart

It's hilarious that these incidents took place in cities with a high level of Liberal/left support  The self described pillars of public health care  But it isn't surprising given the hypocrisy of people of that persuasion 

And to the Liberal hacks on this board    what are your thoughts (assuming you even have any) on this?

Hedy Fry the Liberal MP for Vancouver Centre suggested on Thursday that members of Parliament should get their own H1N1 clinic on Parliament Hill-- which presumably would allow MPs and their staff to receive the swine-flu vaccine on a priority basis ahead of ordinary citizens  Her reasoning? MPs are at risk:We shake hands with people I don't know how many times a day 

I look forward to your response  It will be entertaining to watch you twist yourselves into knots of filament logic

Great post Tax me! I'm Canadian  but I can only hope the lefties on here have at least half a brain in them so that they are able recognize the valuable insight within your post 

----

Although I appreciate the kudos please don't turn it into a left/right thing 

I find when the argument boils down to the essence it is really liberty vs  tyranny 

Some focus on individual liberty and would seek to expand it yet others are concerned what others do with that liberty and seek to limit it  However both camps use the same word equality to describe their policies  One seeks to maximize individual liberty so that all are equal to pursue life liberty property and the pursuit of happiness and yet others seek to limit that same sphere by imposing restrictions on everyone so all are equal 

The opposite of liberty is tyranny  The smallest minority on earth is the individual  If we don't protect the individual we do not protect the minority and breed a society of cannibals by word or deed where 50 plus 1 percent may trample the right(s) of 50 minus one percent  Mob rules and might makes right   is it moral? Ring a bell?

Private clinics with wealthy clients compete for the same resources whether it be drugs or health care professionals  It leads to rising costs of health care which end up increasing costs to employers and loss of international competitiveness and then loss of jobs  Just look at the U S  struggling to turn things around

I think what many people are forgetting is how health care services are delivered in Canada and the really awkward dance between provinces/territories/and the federal government 

The provinces want autonomy but they still want support from Ottawa  They have their own and very different procedures from jurisdiction to jurisdiction they have their own provincial legislation and then we have the federal legislation  I don't have a solution because once you give away power it is very difficult to gain it back but perhaps issues like vaccination etc  should be 100% under federal control (that would thrill Quebec wouldn't it) because it is in the best national interest and in the best interests of public health

If the various governments had not dropped the ball on this by opening the doors to all Canadians with a pulse rather than all whom are at high risk of serious infection then there would panic or shortage 
I'm sorry I don't have a private clinic  If I had 3000 doses you'd see 3000 pregnant women vaccinated in short order rather than holed up in their houses trying to avoid infection (with a 5x - 6x higher rate of infection and complications)  At only a few bucks per dose I'd gladly offer this service out of my own pocket

The USA spends more per person on average than any other nation in the world but USA residents are not the healthiest or the longest lived  If you don't believe me check out the CIA World Fact book website 

Canada isn't at the top for healthy life expectancy but we still live 2 (men) to 3 (women) years longer than Americans 

What exactly is broken about a health care system which helps Canadians to live longer at lower cost than Americans?

The current production delays by GXS should give people reason to think twice about Lyin Brian selling out Canada on Compulsory Licensing back in the 1980s 
Since then the cost of prescriptions has jumped to the top rank of health care costs and we still can't get vaccines when we need them 

Pharmacos spend more on advertising and executive salary and bonuses than they do on research  What research Pharmacos still do is focused on recreational drug research such as finding the next Viagra or Cialis

So did BC  And other jurisdictions also ask every one to come in disregarding the priority list  Clearly there was federal guidance to the provinces and territories that will be abundant supplies 

I am against private clinics but Medcan and the like were drafted simply because small family doctor practices couldn't effectively schedule 10 consecutive appointments for H1N1 shot without impacting other patients and the complicated paperwork 

Change to unadjuvanted vaccine you will see an immediate jump in family doctor participation

Since it's no worse than the regular flu and since there's no pandemic or anything what's the problem?

Why is everyone in a panic?

How do you know the government dropped the ball? Are you 100% sure everything about this is the government's fault?

Is there some rule that says every person who wants a shot has to be able to have one like now?

People are afraid because they stupidly bought into all the hysteria

The U S  has asked GSK to report after a 2 year study on after effects  Health Canada may be collecting this on behalf of GSK who will use our experience to try to sell to the U S  This may or may not be the only intent but it is still beneficial to GSK

Also the US spends more per capita on PUBLIC health care than Canada does 

But so what? The best health care systems are not public ones    (Canada is #39)    the best ones are blended public AND private

Am I the only one checking the numbers on this story before swallowing the headline without giving it any thought?

From yesterday's article Health officials caught off guard by demand for H1N1 shot:
For the past three weeks Ontario has received about 720000 doses per week but this week the province's allotment from the federal government's allotment is only 189500 doses 

That means that in the last three weeks Ontario has received 2349500 doses that are being used by regular old public doctors and hospitals to inoculate their high-risk patients  Ontario's population is somewhere around 13 million so that amounts to enough doses for about 18% of the population 

From today's aricle: Medcan a clinic in downtown Toronto that charges just under $2000 for a head-to-toe checkup received 3000 doses last Friday enough for 8 per cent of its patients 

So the private clinic actually got fewer doses per capita than the rest of us did and a rather tiny number compared to the total the province has received  Assuming they have just as many high risk patients as the general population seems to me their patients got the short end of the stick not the other way around

So carrierre you believe in 2 tier HC ?

VERNIE I do not believe in 2 tier as that denotes different levels of care 

I believe in different health Care delivery methods when the primary method is not working 

I DO NOT believe in the queue jumping that exists to a huge degree today in the public system 

That being said our current system does not allow for proper care in numerous cases  We lack doctors because they can't earn what they believe they deserve 

Provinces lack budgets to perform procedures  Beds are empty surgical or endoscopy suites are quiet because of strained budgets and lack of doctors who have fled for greener pastures 

The mix of a Partnership between public and private is not a difficult concept  I have explained this to you several times in the past 

Simply put you force doctors to provide a deemed amount of public work based on budgets and allow them to work the private system if they wish 

If you can get people out of the lines that can pay for their procedures this shortens the lines for those who cannot  How can that be bad?

After reading the comments from some here it is easy to understand they lack the knowledge and information of how the system works 

The negative knee--jerk reactions are the proof of ones who would not partake in an adult conversation of how this partnership could work 

Then you have the foolish politicians playing on the same 'fears' hoping to garner votes

Harper is dreaming of his majority so he can privatize our health care system and is waiting to bring in his republican friends -

Big money here!

Our system works but if Harper starves the provinces out of funds to carry out this H1N1 campaign -it gives the allusion that our system is not working

Why didn't they include family Dr's in the planning - nothing makes senses except that Harper is laughing at Canadians and can't wait to cut the umbical cord to our universal health care system 

Here are a few quotes from Harper:

What we clearly need is experimentation with market reforms and private delivery options [in health care] 
- Stephen Harper then President of the NCC 2001 

I know this is a dangerous subject  My advisors say don't talk about it but the fact is sometimes provinces have allowed in the past few years they've brought in private services covered by public health insurance    Why do I care and why do we care as a federal government how they're managed? What we care about is whether people can access them  This is just an ideological agenda 
- Conservative leader Stephen Harper at the leadership debate June 15th 2004 conceding that he shouldn't talk about his positive view of privatization of health care 

It's past time the feds scrapped the Canada Health Act 
- Stephen Harper then Vice-President of the National Citizens Coalition 1997 


Sadly Harper does not believe in Canada

   and sadly Cons don't like to hear the truth

Reading between the lines of this piece we have two clinics who put their orders for vaccine in and have received some of them 

Whose fault is that? The clinic's because they ordered them? They only receive what the provinces give them nothing else 

There is also nothing in the piece that tells us that people who are not in the risk groups have jumped the queue  I know that here in BC no one who is not in the identified risk groups has received the vaccine  I haven't received the vaccine and my kids who are under 5 have not 

This seems like a partisan hack job that is deflecting away from the true problem here which is that the vaccine is in short supply and that we only found out about the short supply very recently

Are you suggesting people opt-out of socialized medicine and concentrate the expense of it on the remaining people who laud it?

Whoa  It doesn't work that way  Those who advocate socialized medicine will call for the initiation of force against you if you try and escape  They think if they have to deal with its pitfalls so should you  Sharing the pain so to speak 

If and when the costs of socialized medicine are transferred directly to the backs of those who advocate it I'm pretty sure you'll see a dramatic drop in support for it  Same for supporters of war etc etc

The majority of private clinic members are company paid or well above average income  Medcan say 35% are private individuals -- true but most of them expense it through their company primarily through flexible expense spending 
They do not provide health care --- high priced physicals and medicals that many executives are required to have 
If people want to join them go ahead  No problem 
However their fees should not earn them any rights or privileges with respect to anything such as real health care or in this case vaccines

Ahhh if we were allowed to see what the free market cost of health care and dental care are 

You do know there are cartelization forces at play in these industries right?

Matter of fact I think my dentists' prices are getting a bit to uppity these days 

Think I'll ask him how he sets his prices  Dollars to donuts it's some sort of industry guidelines published by some sort of association dentists *MUST* be a member of to have permission to be a dentist 

Think I'll ask him what happens if he (a) undercuts those set prices and (b) advertises those set prices in the paper to openly compete with other dentists 

Methinks the dentist's cartel will not look favourably on that  Not at all  I wonder what the failure to abide by the governance of our high standards of dental care services issuances will look like  Not invited into the club where the big dogs pee? Shunned at the ol' dentists social soirée? Or a big ol' denied stamped on the dentist license 

Ahhh if only I were rich and could afford a house if the BoC would stop preventing house prices from falling and trying to re-inflate the housing bubble

I see this story like nearly every other story about h1n1 has the obligatory shot of a crying child 

EMLA caps avoid most of the distress but they have to be applied about 1 hour in advance  I guess it could be hard to get the timing right if you are waiting in a long line  We found they worked very well with out children for Health Unit vaccinations which happen at a more predictable time 

EMLA is available either as a single use or as a kit where you fill the caps as you need them from a tube

We already pay for health care nothing is free  Those who go to private clinics have already paid and will pay more for the private service 

Why is their such a panic over H1N1 the numbers don't support the public outcry over this

I cannot believe that when the United States is looking to implement a national health care system we are letting ours become Americanized  I have lived on both sides of the border and I tell you the Canadian system is so much superior and here we are letting it be taken over by private interests  Harper said many times in the past that he wants to get rid of the Canadian health act  What stupid Canadians are voting for him?

The government has informed us that there is no shortage  Strange I don't know anyone (with the exception of my doctor) who has been able to get an H1N1 shot but that must just be a coincidence  I wonder if these private clinics make their pregnant patients stand out in the rain for 6 hours before they get the vaccine  Or perhaps they one of those state of the art system that let's you book an appointment 
The government has created panic confusion spent a lot of money and has not been completely honest  Is anyone concerned that private clinics distributing vaccine will do any worse  What is so good about free when it is not available and costly to taxpayers?

I actually know a Japanese gangster (yakuza) who had liver cancer  I met him in a lineup for cancer treatment  He turned out to be a nice guy  The extra money he spent on his cancer treatment didn't help in the end  He lost the battle  My point is that we are all human beings  Let's focus on the real issues rather than trying to score political points

I am a family physician at a clinic with over 20 family docs who see people from all walks of life  We applied for the right to distribute the H1N1 vaccine as soon as it was possible to do so met the requirements and were informed we were to get 5000 doses  We got 500 last week  We have no membership fee have a large number of patients that are in the high-priority groups and treat everyone regardless of income or ability  This discrepancy makes no sense and I certainly hope there will be a rigourous review of policy   and soon

An admittedly simplistic view - by having private clinics service those willing to pay the rich are provided a shorter line  By doing so they pull themselves out of the 'everybody else' line which in turn becomes shorter as well  In the end everyone moves up a notch or two     the rich just move up faster

What the H1N1 vaccination program is proving is that there is no more effective motivator than fear (real or perceived)  The strategists behind the vaccine campaign are playing the public like a Stradivarius in the hands of a virtuoso by using the same your neighbor or even your best buddy could be a terrorist plotting to kill you fear driver to bully those who have done their homework into rolling up their sleeves and getting the shot by portraying them as 'influenza terrorists' 

The H1N1 epidemic that was going to kill millions is turning out to be 'no show'  Those who do get infected are suffering only a mild experience  By all accounts H1N1 has already peaked  But this won't stop the health system bureaucrats from pushing the program until every last shot of vaccine has been shot even after the enemy is long ago dead  If they relent it will become obvious that they have handed the pharmaceutical industry an enormous windfall paid for with our tax dollars

If you favour European-style care does this mean you support public dental care? How about public prescription plans for ALL Canadians? What about public nursing homes?

These are just three examples of how Europeans have a far larger public health care system then Canadians  In fact their average is between 80-90% public delivery of total health services versus our 65% (and shrinking) 

Meanwhile there is never any discussion about our 35% privatised health services (like dental care and prescription drugs) that are seeing the fastest rising costs and insurance premiums for Canadians 

Europe doesn't have a more mixed system it has a more PUBLIC system  Keep masking your European-style babble for increased privatisation of what's still in the public system 

As far as this article goes  If a private clinic wants to shoot their rich Executives first then use PRIVATE funds to purchase PRIVATE supply 

Surely all the free market types should support this but as usual they see no problem with complaining about socialism but being the first in line to get its benefits  Today's capitalists are the ultimate welfare queens 

Public funds should be used for publicly delivered services

What if naturopaths or other alternative health providers were offering the vaccine? Probably not as controversial but basically the same thing 

And why isn't it offensive that people who could afford the time to line up for 8 hours have earlier access to the vaccine?

Problem is this---in the next couple of years parents will experience the soul-destroying pain of having a young child diagnosed with Autism 

Having a bunch of 'experts' say that the H1N1 'couldn't' be to blame will offer little comfort 

I've already suffered the pain (after giving my son all 'state of the art' vaccines 4 years ago)  I still ask myself everytime he stares blankly into space whether or not I did this to him 

Offering my condolences in advance to the parents who face this gut-wrenching scenario  It's horrible

Dr  Bortolussi how can you say that even on a theoretical basis it does not pose any risk to children? What about the studies done with rodents where squalene injections caused numerous autoimmune problems such as arthritis and lupus? See for example the study by Holm et al in the March 2002 issue of Clinical & Experimental Immunology or Carlson et al in the June 2000 issue of The American Journal of Pathology  Also in the Feb 19 2009 FDA advisory committee meeting on vaccine candidates this issue (autoimmunity problems) arose several times and most of the scientists present discussed it as being at least theoretical and worthy of further research  Also my understanding from the clinical tests that have been done is that the sample size for children was quite small  I'm not trying to convince anyone that it is dangerous but I do think it warrants more research  If you or another expert in this field can enlighten me as to why no more research is needed in this regard (i e  why you are so sure it is safe for children) please let me know  Thank you

Stop changing the channel 

It is not JUST about H1N1  If the GSK vaccine contains only the H1N1 antigen without the adjuvant then we won't have this discussion  The Chairman's claim was that the squalene adjuvant (for our Canadian GSK AS03 adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine) is safe  The debate is about the safety of squalene adjuvant IN the adjuvanted vaccine 

GSK used the H5N1 vaccine with the same AS03 squalene adjuvant to be used in the H1N1 vaccine as the mock up experience in their submissions for regulatory approvals for the H1N1 adjuvanted vaccine  And even then GSK admits that there is not enough experience and data especially in young people 

The Chairman disparaged himself in making those remarks with no scientific basis  It is no one's fault than his own to look like an idiot 

People who make public statement as Chairman of Pediatrics should be able to accept scrutiny 

You ad hominem attack me is pointless  It merely shows you have nothing to counter what I posted which was simply GSK's own words 

May be you and the Chairman can share the meal of eating your words

I worry about you getting autoimmune disorders as a statistic several years down the road should you inject yourself with the squalene adjuvanted vaccine 

Count how many rolls of toilet paper you need for the rest of your life  Some patients with those ailments literally live out of the bathroom hardly ever be able to go downstairs nor outdoors and certainly not without practically full time care giver 

May be it won't happen to you  May be it will  The clinical trial was conducted for only 200 people in Belgian and for a short time of only a few weeks  However animal models have demonstrated without doubt that those ailments clearly follow inject with squalene although in doses that no one dare to try on humans

all clinical trials (especially animal ones) have limitations  Sure injecting 100% squalene into rat tails causes them crazy diseases 

But if you fed a rat pure salt it would die of hypernatremia  If you gave it the purest oxygen to breathe it would get blindness in the form of retina damage  If you gave it too much water to drink it would die of hyponatremia  If you gave it lots of iron supplements it would die of hemmorhagic colitis

It is evident that the Globe has decided to make a holus-bolus adoption of the stance of the drug-makers and globalizers on this subject and consequently balance objectivity and rigourous transmittal of actual facts will not be available from this source (as is increasingly usual)

Article states: But Canadian health experts have agreed the risk of adjuvanted vaccine appears small
I e  we think the risk is small -- good grief

The article asserts that any opinion that contrasts this definitive conclusion based on solid data (sarcasm for those who missed it) is conspirationalist in nature (conspiratorial websites) Good grief

So just where is this good doctor in Halifax getting his information regarding the adjuvanted vaccine's safety?

Citing GSK's and the WHO's own admissions of lack of solid gold standard data regarding the experimental pandemic vaccine Swiss health authorities have today forbid (that's right -- FORBID) GSK's squalene-laced poison to be injected into a huge portion of the Swiss population 

Here's an excerpt from the announcement translated from German to English 

Below that are links both to the translated announcement and to the announcement in the original German 

Swissmedic the authority in Switzerland that gives permission for the use of drugs today announced that the 'swine flu' vaccine Pandemrix will not be allowed to be injected into pregnant women children or young adults (below 18 years of age) or elderly (above 60 years of age)

Fredrich Hoffmann the head of Germany's national vaccine commission has told doctors that they should give the untested swine flu jab to their patients no matter what their opinion about it might be but German doctors are refusing to bow down and be bullied 

The German national vaccine commission is made up of members with financial and other ties to pharmaceutical companies and so it does not come as a surprise that Hoffmann is putting pressure on German doctors to give patients the lethal swine flu jab even though those same doctors will be liable to pay compensation for any damage and death caused by the jabs because the pharma companies have been given immunity 

However doctors in Germany are refusing to be bullied by the authorities in league with big pharma into rolling out a swine flu jab campaign that will make billions for vaccine companies 

Dr J Seefeldt a specialist in internal medicine from Paderborn sent an open letter to the Dr Susanne Str an official from the German drug regulator the Paul Ehrlich Institute pointing out the reason why her statement in the media that the swine flu jab was not risky was an infamous lie 

Seefeldt systematically lists the dangers of squalene and mercury citing relevant scientific literature  He also notes that these toxic ingredients are not necessary for making a vaccine 

You should desist in future in the interest of the rest of the population from making false statements of this kind and to put your efforts and energy into making swine flu vaccines without squalene and mercury he writes

As a parent - I am truly tortured by this!! I personally will not be getting the vaccine but should I risk my child's life and not protect him  I do have to say that just because an MD states something is safe does not automatically wash with me  Do they really and truly know? What percentage of MD's had endorsed Hormone Replacement Therapy for years only to later discover that the Test Lab of real life in real bodies had issues  Or for how long have food companies added extreme levels of sodium high fructose corn syrup or trans fat and the medical community is only now acknowleding that these ingredients are not well recieved by the human body  A trained MD is skilled at knowing anatomy body and doing surgical procedures but can we expect them to definitively understand the impact of foreign substances on individual bodies  The relative newness of this vaccine and its dodgey ingredients gives me great doubt and for anyone to say emphatically that it is 100% safe for 100% of the population seems really proposterous  But also the threat of the worst case scenario happening looms large and so the internal debate rages within me

Well you can get your medical advice from a real doctor who will say the adjuvant is safe or you can get your medical advice from a quack (e g  someone 'trained' in homeopathy) who will tell you how dangerous it is  And if you want to listen to the quack I'm sure you can find tonnes of material on the internet to support that perspective  But just remember a quack is a quack

Well sorry folks we have something worse than adjuvants to worry about 

It's called waaaaattter  government is forcing you to drink this poison available on taps bottled reverse osmosis distilled 

don't suffer a similar fate of the 'hold pee for wii' lady who unlike our educated flu-shot naysayers here didn't know that water was a deadly poison 

This government conspiracy to force us to drink this poison has finally been exposed

Why not just offer un-adjuvated vaccine?

Why is it SOOOOOO important for the health care establishment that people sample the barely tested versions????

- - - -

The ostensible reason is making more doses  There is some validity to that argument but it is not a strong argument if you have a combination of low case fatality rate of H1N1 and tiny trial size of 200 subjects in a very short span of time  If we have an H5N1 pandemic today I would agree the 60% case fatality rate justifies making every one a guinea pig  The U S  government bought a stockpile of squalene adjuvants from Novartis and GSK enough to make 600 million doses of pandemic vaccine  They are very short of H1N1 vaccine and yet they refuse to use the adjuvant stockpile to create more H1N1 vaccine doses 

For Canada GSK donated 20% of the production capacity of our plant paid for by our tax payers and also exported a certain quantity of our output and yet we still have 50 million doses of adjuvanted which in itself would have meant 12 5 million doses of unadjuvanted vaccine with the same amount of antigen  Canada could have made even more unadjuvanted vaccines enough to build so much community immunity that H1N1 would hardly spread 

The motivation for vaccine makers is intellectual property rights  Without the proprietary adjuvants a vaccine can become generic  With a high barrier for adjuvant regulatory approval once obtained it also becomes a barrier to new entrants in the marketplace 

GSK's interest is not the same as Canadian interest  Some how the government has been completely passive over this issue as has the opposition 

Rot to the core

all clinical trials (especially animal ones) have limitations  Sure injecting 100% squalene into rat tails causes them crazy diseases 

But if you fed a rat pure salt it would die of hypernatremia  If you gave it the purest oxygen to breathe it would get blindness in the form of retina damage  If you gave it too much water to drink it would die of hyponatremia  If you gave it lots of iron supplements it would die of hemmorhagic colitis

That is why they use animals that closely approximate humans (ferrets) for initial tests  The purpose is to identify red flags and then start ACTIVELY look for those signs in human trials even after diluting the potion 

What we have here is a situation of knowing the red flags and purposely avoiding to look for those signs in humans 

This is achieved by:

1  using squalene adjuvant in the placebo

2  claiming squalene safety in injected vaccines based on safety when applied as a skin absorbed cosmetic

3  having a tiny clinical trial size of 200

4  lots of public messaging appealing to emotion with no science to back it up (such as this story) to change public opinion

As a parent - I am truly tortured by this!! I personally will not be getting the vaccine but should I risk my child's life and not protect him  I do have to say that just because an MD states something is safe does not automatically wash with me  Do they really and truly know? What percentage of MD's had endorsed Hormone Replacement Therapy for years only to later discover that the Test Lab of real life in real bodies had issues  Or for how long have food companies added extreme levels of sodium high fructose corn syrup or trans fat and the medical community is only now acknowleding that these ingredients are not well recieved by the human body  A trained MD is skilled at knowing anatomy body and doing surgical procedures but can we expect them to definitively understand the impact of foreign substances on individual bodies  The relative newness of this vaccine and its dodgey ingredients gives me great doubt and for anyone to say emphatically that it is 100% safe for 100% of the population seems really proposterous  But also the threat of the worst case scenario happening looms large and so the internal debate rages within me

Write to your MP and tell him or her that you want GSK to make more unadjuvanted vaccine not just for pregnant women but also for kids  Since GSK is switching production line this week it makes sense to make more 

Canada needs no more than 33 million doses  2 million unadjuvanted doses have already been ordered  If only 26 million doses of adjuvanted vaccines are made the rest of the planned production of 24 million (total 50 4) million doses of adjuvanted vaccines can be changed to 6 million doses of unadjuvanted vaccines 

The net result is 26 million adjuvanted and 8 million unadjuvanted vaccines

AS03 has never been in use in Canada in any product  It has only been approved for one product - a pre-pandemic H5N1 vaccine in Europe but since there hasn't been an H5N1 pandemic it really hasn't been used in real people  Bear in mind with a case fatality rate of 60% the threshold for H5N1 approval is much lower 

Animals models should have been the first step  However the data is considered proprietary and is not published 

This vaccine roll out is a clinical trial in all but name  That is why the waiver and the complicated forms  GSK wants the U S  to approve the adjuvanted vaccine  The U S  won't approve it and has asked GSK to conduct a 2-year post injection study which will likely be based on real people in Canada and Europe 

We are put out as guinea pigs

Check out today's World Health Organization website - www WHO int - they are now saying that more testing is needed on children under ten  Imagine that!! Funny that the Canadian Paediatric Society has already stated there are no risks  This is why we need to be our own trusted advisors and recognize that MD's are not authorities on the impacts of pharmaceuticals on our individual bodies  People are complaining that vaccines were not out earlier - so they would have like LESS testing - can't figure that out at all!!!! Anyway - use your judgement - do research and be healthy

Has AS03 been tested in animal models with similar relative dosage  Can the author of this article please contact GSK for that data 

Also what other vaccine has this ingredient that has been in use in Canada  Please name the vaccine 

I wasn't worried about AS03 at all till I realized that that all these long lineups for the shots are related to signing and distribution of waver forms!!

There shall be no waver forms when distributing vaccines

Here’s by bottom line: I would fight at all cost to ensure that you and your children get the un-adjuvanted vaccine  The nasal mist would have been better yet but is not available in Canada  One of the ingredients of concern here is “Squalene” which is being made to sound like it’s something you would find in a health food store: vitamin E and shark liver oil  If you do your own search of Squalene you discover that it is thought to be the main cause of “Gulf War Syndrome”  It would seem that in its rush to garner pats on the back this government has opted for the diluted (adjuvanted) form of the vaccine i e  a smaller amount of Antigen plus the booster instead of the un-adjuvanted one which is slower to produce and is what is being produced for the home crowd in the States  So far they can say that there are few or no adverse effects being reported in clinical trial but realistically how long do you think it would take for someone to show signs of neurological toxicity or Lupus? I do believe that it is important to get vaccinated against H1N1 but I don’t appreciate the limited options this government has left us with  Yes it would be best for all of us if the whole country was quickly inoculated but at the personal level don’t we all want to ensure the safety of our children and loved ones with the best vaccine options available? Do your own research (lookup Thimerosal and Squalene) and don’t count on your overworked MD to be able to review all the safety data on every new drug that is being shoved his way  Just my opinion…

Concerned-One- I have checked the FDA site and literature and there is no indication that Squalene was or is used in any vaccine in USA  I also wonder if all this hoopla and waver mania and secrecy are the the result of the fake accusations  Lets be truthful here

On September 21 Health Canada boldly announced they were buying unadjuvanted vaccine for young children and pregnant women  Is this still the case?

This just in offers an excellent analysis that bear repeating:

'Canada needs no more than 33 million doses  2 million unadjuvanted doses have already been ordered  If only 26 million doses of adjuvanted vaccines are made the rest of the planned production of 24 million (total 50 4) million doses of adjuvanted vaccines can be changed to 6 million do","

No one said the Gulf War Syndrome was caused by a LICENSED AND APPROVED squalene adjuvanted VACCINE for general population  It was caused by the military version of squalene adjuvanted anthrax vaccine 

The Gulf War Syndrome issue was about U S  military personnel getting the military mandatory Anthrax Vaccine  Military vaccines can be experimental and soldiers cannot refuse cannot sue cannot even talk about it 

You are trying to deny the existence of Gulf War Syndrome due to squalene adjuvanted flu vaccine  The first squalene adjuvanted flu vaccine was your Novartis Fluad with MF59 squalene adjuvant in 1997  The First Gulf War was in 1990 

You are a vaccine propagandist plain and simple  Your series of twisted logic and distortions merely prove that you have zero credibility

Just-In- you are not telling the truth on both accounts  Again the document that was referenced was not Novartis's 

Referring to Golf Syndrome the FDA document that I have posted has examined all the evidence and all these claims such as yours have failed to be proven to be factual and no Squalane was ever in any Anthrax vaccine other than minute amounts traced to finger prints 
'''''There is no squalene adjuvant in any US-licensed vaccine''''''
http://www fda gov/ohrms/dockets/dockets/80n0208/80n-0208-c000037-15-01-vol151 pdf

Squalane has not caused gulf syndrome and that is a fact and all those that say otherwise are lying 

There many possible causes of disease in Gulf war syndrome including chemical warfare agents or even fine dust 

Read the following chapter:
''''INFECTIOUS DISEASES ENDEMIC TO SOUTHWEST AND SOUTH-CENTRAL ASIA THAT HAVE LONG-TERM ADVERSE HEALTH OUTCOMES'''''
http://books nap edu/openbook php?record_id=11765&page=181

I would be worried about coccidioidomycosis infections that are common in arid regions and there is no vaccine for that type of fungal infection so you don't have to worry about it but others will 
http://www cureresearch com/c/coccidioidomycosis/stats-country htm

When I look at anti vaccine propaganda on the net it seems really vicious  Perhaps anti vaccine motto is now being used as new terror tactic to cause massive kill offs even encouraging the population to avoid polio or measles vaccines

Keep up the DECEPTION  Of course it is not in the LICENSED vaccine  I never said it was in a U S  LICENSED vaccine  The FDA won't approve squalene for use in the civilian population 

It was in the military anthrax vaccine which did NOT have to go through the same FDA licensing as those use on civilian population 

It is quite clear you are a vaccine shill  I have seen your talking points before rolled out for an unsuspecting public 

TESSSA will now be IGNORED 

One tactic of vaccine shills (with an unlimited budget for propaganda) is to keep lying on frivolous deceptions in order to bog down conscientious objectors so that these objectors don't have any time left  I am not taking this bait

To say since there is no civilian vaccine with squalene in the U S  and to argue therefore Gulf War Syndrome wasn't caused by squalene IS THE SAME DECEPTIVE METHOD that is used by Novartis to call squalene safe in injection by citing safety in skinne absorbed cosmetic as proof

Just-In- I don't work for any vaccine company none  My only presence on this board related to my kid's condition alone  But your comments seem very rigid and you are resistant to facts and references  You must be paid to post this comments yourself because they is documentation that disproves your comments 

Did you read the FDA document!? Yes or NO?

If you did why are are you still lying  What is the purpose of these lies  Here read it again  Tell the truth  Truth matters regardless of one's position 

'''''In September 2000 DOD became aware of FDA test results finding trace amounts of squalene in three out of three US vaccines tested: tetanus diphtheria and anthrax  The level of squalene identified by the FDA test is so minute that it is likely the result of squalene in the oil of a fingerprint not completely cleaned from lab
glassware  It is hard to completely remove fingerprint oils from glassware  Before they go looking for squalene lab workers have to use a chemical solvent such as hexane to completely remove their own fingerprint oils from lab
glassware  When lab workers intentionally tested an extract of fingerprint oil the squalene reading went off the chart 

Before the FDA test results became known Stanford Research International (SRI) under DOD contract looked for squalene in anthrax vaccine  At the limit of detection of its test 140 parts per billion SRI found no squalene in several lots of anthrax vaccine  The FDA’s test which was developed later is more sensitive  It is able to
detect as little as IO parts per blllion  The FDA found squalene at 10 to 83 parts per billion in diphtheria toxoid tetanus toxoid and anthrax vaccine  The trace level of squalene found by the FDA in anthrax vaccine is less than the concentration naturally present in human blood (250 parts per billion) (Miettinen 1982; Nikkila et al 1992)'''''

I finally read the document you linked  Notice the footers  It was a military document and a marketing documents with lots of claims but without proof  It was NOT a FDA document  It was put on the FDA website  The DOD owned the jurisdiction for this particular document  The FDA left the DOD source in the footers in a subtle way so readers know where it came from 

As for SRI it is not exactly as civilian or independent as you may want to belief  It is a military contractor  As well it was the DOD who hired SRI  The claims are questionable if not open to civilian oversight  Please post the SRI report 

The claim by DOD of no squalene in THIS DOCUMENT (a marketing document not one for example in a public hearing) was not corroborated by DOD's own response to inquiry from the U S  General Accounting Office (GAO) 

See this here with links to various documents 

QUOTE

A GAO report in 1999 Questions About the Presence of Squalene Antibodies in Veterans Can Be Resolved states

We cannot say definitively whether or not Gulf War-era veterans were given vaccines with adjuvant formulations containing squalene for a number of reasons  Although DOD officials told us they did not administer such vaccines they stated they did not have documentation on the process and results of decision-making related to the administration of vaccines at the time of the Gulf War  Also some officials involved in the decisions were no longer employed with DOD at the time of our review and we were either unable to locate them or they declined to be interviewed 

END QUOTE

Notice the difference in wording  The DOD wasn't even willing to outright deny the use of squalene in THE anthrax vaccine USED IN THE FIRST GULF WAR  We don't know for example if SRI tested the SAME anthrax vaccine  It is quite possible that subsequent to the problems with lupus found in Gulf War veterans (male included) the military could have changed the anthrax vaccine formulation

In 2009 another attempt was made to quell the squalene antibodies controversy  Unfortunately the study excluded (from counting) certain symptoms of what would be exhibited by those with autoimmune disorders 

See this thread and the comment in particular:

http://preview tinyurl com/y9rtlef

QUOTE

The fact that so many eligible vets were excluded from the study raises significant questions regarding the legitimacy of the data  It suggests the protocol itself (study design bias) was biased against finding any relationship between vaccination and GWS  Since the DOD did the study (institutional bias) this too represents a significant bias that can not be discounted and it alone could be grounds for discounting their findings since they are potentially liable for causing GWS in the vets they forced to be vaccinated some against their will 

The DOD is not an objective organization  The findings of all DOD studies conducted by DOD personnel or contractors are subject to both executive and military review  Any findings developed that are not consistent with DOD policy can be changed by executive authority to make it consistent 

IMO the question asked by the investigators is an important one but it can not be answered by this study due to the design bias (indicated by the exclusion of so many eligible subjects) and by institutional bias (the DOD is not capable of conducting an objective study of itself and its policies especially when one considers the severe political career and economic consequences of there being a causal link found between use of squalene and GWS)

This study should be repeated but not by the DOD  A new protocol needs to be written that eliminates design bias that includes a new case definition for GWS that has been developed by an independent panel of experts  The study should be funded by the US Congress but conducted by an outside organization without any DOD relationships 

(reaching 2000 character limit)

The bottom line is still this:

The FDA is unwilling to approve the use of squalene adjuvants in H1N1 vaccines 

They have asked GSK to come back in 2 years with reports of post-injection studies  GSK is using Canadians (and Europeans) as guinea pigs to further its marketing efforts to the U S

Justin-Just-Read-It- its so lovely to see that you 'just' read the document after denying the content for days upon days 

That document references FDA's test results and it is FDA's data that shows no Squelene was in those vaccines and it being listed on FDA site proves that it is an authentic document 

The fact you believe that there is conspiracy for all these US institutions to lie so that they could inject American soldiers with a substance that FDA had not yet approved for use in USA is not surprising 

But no vaccine maker is going to add what is not approved in their vaccine good or bad whatever is in the vaccine is what they sell post approval 

Tainting usage of squelene in vaccine was also convenient for those that needed an easy answer for the syndrome

The anthrax vaccine was given to First Gulf War soldiers in 1990  Being military means it is completely outside of FDA jurisdiction  DOD military vaccine does not need FDA licensing  Soldiers cannot refuse cannot talk about it and cannot sue afterwards if things go wrong 

The first civilian flu vaccine with squalene in the world was from Novartis Fluad for seniors 65 and over approved in Italy then subsequently automatically approved for other countries in the EU for reciprocal reasons

Novartis Fluad approved in 1997 in Europe 

DOD military anthrax vaccine approved in 1990 

FDA never approved squalene adjuvants in civilian vaccine 

SRI did the study for DOD based on data from the military  FDA wasn't even involved 


Trying to associate an anthrax mil document posted on FDA website is like me quoting putting up a GSK ca link and some one said Globeandmail wrote the GSK report 

Tessa stop insulting people's intelligence

You are finally admitting that the anthrax vaccine was military after deceiving people about FDA no licensing squalene to prove squalene not in anthrax vaccine 

You are using circular arguments and deceptive logic

A letter head doesn't mean it was FDA data at least not in 1990  Bioport Corporation was a military vaccine contractor formed in 1998 not 1990 when the first Gulf War anthrax vaccine shot was given to soldiers  As I said you haven't proved it was the same vaccine  Even the GAO report said DOD refused to deny the existence of squalene - they could only claim no body knew

I will post links to 2 papers one on the test at Tulane University that found anti-squalene antibodies (ASA)in recipients of CERTAIN LOTS of anthrax vaccine who also had GWS symptoms the other was the DOD commission study by SRI (a military contractor) not FDA that tested CERTAIN LOTS of anthrax vaccines and found no or only trace amount of squalene  There is no indication that SRI tested the SAME LOTS that were administered to veterans showing GWS symptoms  The Tulane was clear – anti-squalene antibodies squalene in those vaccine lots GWS were all associated 


The Tulane paper:

Antibodies to squalene in recipients of anthrax vaccine 

http://preview tinyurl com/ygmm75b

QUOTE

Because adverse reactions in vaccinated personnel were similar to symptoms of GWS we tested AVIP participants for anti-squalene antibodies (ASA)  In a pilot study 6 of 6 vaccine recipients with GWS-like symptoms were positive for ASA  In a larger blinded study only 32% (8/25) of AVIP personnel compared to 15 7% (3/19) of controls were positive (P /> 0 05)  Further analysis revealed that ASA were associated with specific lots of vaccine 

- snip -

ASA were restricted to personnel immunized with lots of vaccine known to contain squalene 

END QUOTE

THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN GWS AND ANTHRAX VACCINE KNOWN TO HAVE SQUALENE IS CLEAR 

The SRI paper

Enhancement of an analytical method for the determination of squalene in anthrax vaccine adsorbed formulations 

http://preview tinyurl com/yfpu67w

QUOTE

The overall results of this investigation provide direct evidence for the absence of squalene in nearly all of anthrax vaccine preparations tested 

END QUOTE

Certain lots were tested but these lots were not associated with veterans with GWS 

So whether SRI tested lots of anthrax vaccine contained squalene or not was IRRELEVANT 

THIS POINT WAS MERELY A DEFLECTION to absolve DOD of potential liability  They could claim ONLY CERTAIN BATCHES contained squalene

For completeness the paper from year 2000 on GWS:

Antibodies to squalene in Gulf War syndrome

http://www ncbi nlm nih gov/pubmed/10640454?itool=EntrezSystem2 PEntrez Pubmed Pubmed_ResultsPanel Pubmed_RVDocSum&ordinalpos=2

QUOTE

All (100%) GWS patients immunized for service in Desert Shield/Desert Storm who did not deploy but had the same signs and symptoms as those who did deploy had antibodies to squalene  In contrast none (0%) of the deployed Persian Gulf veterans not showing signs and symptoms of GWS have antibodies to squalene 

END QUOTE

So they can't say GWS was caused by depleted uranium on the front lines since even those who were not deployed got GWS

Just-in- I have to replied about Tulane study the assertions by the authors have be negated by the authors themselves 


''''''''One study found that deployed Persian Gulf War Syndrome patients are significantly more likely to have antibodies to squalene (95 percent) than asymptomatic Gulf War veterans (0 percent; p< 001)[9]; however the study concludes with the following statement: It is important to note that our laboratory-based investigations do not establish that squalene was added as adjuvant to any vaccine used in military or other personnel who served in the Persian Gulf War era  A later study reported that many humans have squalene antibodies in their blood regardless of whether or not they received squalene from a vaccination [10]''''''

Thimerosol is currently being used in Canada's regular seasonal flu vaccine I know this because my 75 year old mother just got that flu shot 

Fact - Thimerosol contains 49% mercury by weight 

In my opinion no amount of mercury is exceptable mercury is a toxin end of story!

I will not get any vaccine that contains thimerosol 

At this time I will not get any vaccine containing squalene or any other adjuvant currently in use 

Not because of conspiracy theories but of my own risk assessment  I have doubts & that is reason enough for me to not get injected with an adjuvant vaccines at this time 

I don't believe there's any conspiracy regarding vaccines I do however distrust medical sciences assessments & the levels of risk our governments are willing to subject us to 

I came across a very interesting read on squalene it's a USAISC website Whois returns this nameserver DNS-PUB-01-U ARMY PENTAGON MIL

I suggest everyone read it all there's plenty of links also

Now you have two view points although it must be noted the U S  has not approved squalene for use in any vaccine 

That's very important to remember!!

Perhaps they can now get out of their Leather chairs and approve H1N1 Vaccine for everyone asap  But through clinics and doctor's offices as waiting in line for 4 hours is not really a great idea

Up to 1 8 million doses of the advjuant-free vaccine from GlaxoSmithKline will be available to Canadians

However they only made 375000 unadjuvanted doses so far from GSK and have the existing Australian CSL nonadjuvant circulating

Butler Jones on TV was pretty much dictating who will get the adjuvant and nonadjuvant now based on availability in the clinics and advising according to their own new criteria

Do Canadians have a choice?

Article states The unadjuvanted vaccine was previously only intended for pregnant women   

That's NOT TRUE  In September Health Canada said there would be 1 8 to 2 million doses of normal (unadulterated) vaccine for pregnant women and young children 

*quote*
Canada will provide normal swine flu vaccine to
pregnant women younger children
Sharon Kirkey Canwest News Service:
Monday September 28 2009
Canada has ordered 1 8 million doses of
unadjuvanted swine flu vaccine for pregnant
women and children under the age of three
Canada's chief public health officer says 


Canada has ordered 1 8 million doses of
unadjuvanted swine flu vaccine for pregnant
women and children under the age of three
Canada's chief public health officer said Friday 

Adjuvants are substances added to vaccines to
boost a person's immune response to the shots 
While the adjuvant to be used in Canada's H1N1
vaccine — an oil-in-water emulsion — is similar
to one that has been used in Europe with seasonal
flu shots and other vaccines Dr  David Butler-
Jones said there's not yet enough clinical data
on adjuvanted vaccines in pregnant women and
children under three 

Those groups will have the option of using an
unadjuvanted vaccine he said 

*unquote*

And of course it would be interesting to know why we ordered 2 million doses for 278000 preganant women  Invites all sorts of questions

The package insert for the Influenza A (H1N1) 2009 Monovalent Vaccine manufactured by Novartis has been leaked on the Internet  According to that package insert the vaccine (based on an earlier vaccine product known as Fluvirin) is known to cause a whole host of very nasty side effects such as guillain-barre syndrome vasculitis anaphylactic shock and even death 

Of course anyone who has been studying vaccine side effects already knows that it causes all of these things but the story here is that the insert for the swine flu vaccine itself is admitting all of these things  The insert says that it was updated during September 2009 so it reflects the very latest information 

You can read the package insert for this vaccine for yourself right here

Back on September 2 2009

Butler-Jones said:

the Government of Canada has decided to use an adjuvanted vaccine to allow for more vaccine to be produced with less antigen needed

No mention of ordering non-adjuvant back in September on Health canada's website

http://www phac-aspc gc ca/alert-alerte/h1n1/conferences/nc-2009-09-02-eng php

This writer CA had an article back in August Canada's flu strategy flawed: CMAJ

Health authorities should roll out non-adjuvant vaccine for children pregnant women and aboriginal communities the same course being taken by the United States and Europe while the rest of the population can wait for the adjuvant vaccine the journal suggested 

http://www theglobeandmail com/news/national/canadas-flu-strategy-flawed-cmaj/article1271216/


What was Health Canada doing?

Were Leona Health and Butler-Jones not listening?

Is that when their cheese fell off their cracker?

What was the deal here?
To compromise the safety of Canadians?

Then they quickly backtracked ordered a supply from Australia for high-priority pregnant women only since GSK were making only adjuvant   

Now they just approved some nonadjuvant from GSK -375000 (still in the warehouse) doses were made so far and they have finally broadened their criteria -

Let's see if the nonadjuvant vaccine gets in the arms of Canadians
Will the clinics have availability?
When is GSK planning to make the remainder 1425000 unaduvanted doses?

Where is our very own Chauncey Gardiner PM in all of this?

H1N1 that is currently out there is a minor virus in terms of affecting mortality rates 

There are people who are properly concerned    I did not say they knew the answers    I said that they were properly concerned about the 'hype' associated with this virus 

For example:

1: Why would Baxter release 72 kg of live virus for distribution?

2: Why would the WHO issue a pandemic alert when there was/is no pandemic 

--

There are a great many other questions raised at the Canadian website:

URL = www globalresearch ca

I certainly do not know what is going on but the above two items are sufficient for me to be concerned  Something is not right

This has been the most   fiasco of public health I have ever seen  Schools of Management (especially public heath) should use this as a text as to how NOT to micro/mis-manage a crisis (SARS should have taught them something);

First there is little agreement as to who should get it first  Queue jumpers not challenged thus survival of the fittest?;

Ontario so far (including the Chief of Police in Toronto got it as did many hospital donors and board members = shameful = road of blame and shame 

Second everyone blames the other  Feds Provincial Municipal etc 

Third Seasonal flu vaccine is held somewhere and could save far more that the H1N!

Finally WTO recommends antivirals such as Tamiflu  Try and get it anywhere Go see a doctor and incur costs to the provincial health care system for a prescription  The Province of Saskatchewan is the only one providing it FREE so as to lessen deaths 

Is anyone in charge????

   Those of us who ask honest questions are derided as moonbats conspiracy theorists moon-landing deniers and the tinfoil hat crowd by those who repeat untrue statements about the vaccinea and refuse to address simple questions    So when they debase the discussion like that I think 'over-the-top comments like those from Kool are to be expected  And are acceptable in context of how pro-vaccine commentors have damaged the open discussion   

I think it's funny to characterize the discussions that way  I've been on many of these H1N1 threads and the bulk of the name calling has been from the detractors of the medical establishment 

I have routinely posted common knowledge points on H1N1 and been called all sorts of names despite making every attempt not to get bogged down into that type of rhetoric 

Peronsally I think you're justifying these anti-social actions because your points and the points of other detractors simply don't hold water 

By all means prove me wrong  List some facts that you can support to back your claims 

I am always up for a open debate on any issue and ALWAYS attempt to be reasonable at the outset of any discussion but on this topic I've yet to find even one single person who could debate the issue from the anti-vaccine perspective in a reasonably respectful fashion

   This is a win for the age of the internet  Everyone wanted the un-adjuvenated version and now we have it   

You can view it that way if you like but from a public health perspective they're likely just adjusting to the version that will coax the most people to get the shot 

So they started with the quicker easier version and moved to the more expensive but more palatable version after they realized the uptake levels and issues related to it

   Considering all the thumbs up on Kool's comments (that were apparently offensive) one can't wonder just who's very exacting standards were offended   

Let me put it this way  I remember a thread on native issues where one poster submitted a VERY racist comment I will not repeat here  It was of course eventually pulled but before it was there were surprisingly dozens of thumbs up 

So I ask does simple majority agreement make rascism okay?

If not then why would other equally outrageous comments like say calling the people who disagree with you terrorists and nazis be okay?

The point of these discussion thread is to communicate various points of view and debate contentious points or try to sway one another with reasoned advocacy 

I think our capacity to have a meaningful discussion is limited however when we allow brutal attacks to quash the opinions of others and I should hope that all well intentioned people would feel the same 

To me they might as well just stop having discussion boards if we're going to let abusive individuals simply beat everyone else down

My point doesn't hold water???
You mean my point that the adjuvant is untested? That information is quite plain in the product literature direct from GSK:

http://www gsk ca/english/docs-pdf/Arepanrix_PIL_CAPA01v01 pdf

And yet we have medical doctors writing in major Canadian newspapers that the vaccine is made exactly the same way as every other seasonal flu vaccine - WHICH IS A LIE

That is a lovely chart & the Public Health Agency of Canada has provided all the data shown Province & number of dead attributed to H1N1 

Now when it's said the number of deaths confirmed as being due to H1N1 influenza 

Does that mean those who died were actually tested for H1N1 or is it simply assumed they had H1N1?

Frankly the word confirmed is very elusive in this context & doesn't tell me much!

I mean they could have said after testing the number of confirmed deaths has risen due to H1N1 influenza 

Also how many of the confirmed dead received the H1N1 vaccine?

Surely records are kept of those who received the H1N1 flu shot & checking said records would be very simple!

A breakdown of age & sex along with figures on how many of the dead received the flu shot would also be nice 

I'm sorry are my questions to much a little over the top or unnecessary?

Am I out of line asking to be provided with such information?

Why are seniors over 65 at the end of the queue?
Once could almost assume that they consider these individuals expendable  Just think of the saving that will accrue if large numbers of seniors succumb to H1N1  Reduction in Old Age and Canada Pension Plan payments  These same individuals will be permanently eliminated from the health care system and will provide nursing homes with relief from overcrowding  The governments wins on this all the way around

Canadian H1N1 vaccine without adjuvant OK'd

Health Canada has approved the use of adjuvant-free swine flu vaccine made in Canada for pregnant women and healthy people aged 10 to 64 federal health officials announced Friday  (Nov 13)

Up to 1 8 million doses of the adjuvant-free vaccine from GlaxoSmithKline will eventually be available to Canadians said Dr  David Butler-Jones Canada's chief public health officer 

Using the unadjuvanted vaccine will allow more Canadians to be immunized sooner Butler-Jones said at a news conference  This vaccine has been shown to be very effective in those with healthy immune systems 

                                                 

NOT TRUE

The nonadjuvant is being reserved for pregnant women - the clinics are still saying this!

The clinics are still refusing to give nonadjuvant vaccine to healthy people age 10-64

Dr Butler-Jones key word is eventually

probably the 1 8M unadjuvanted doses from GSK were never distributed let alone administered   

Was the CLS nonadjuvant order deemed enough for pregnant women?

Dr FIB-Butler-Jones is his new name from now on

This article is complete garbage     I think the discussion should be different 

I went to the Olympic Oval on Friday to get my kids the shot and there was no one there but nurses  The nurse said oh good we were just about to throw our vaccine away because it is going to expire  She said it only lasts for 24hrs  I hadn't had my shot so said give it to me and she said she couldn't or she would lose her job  So she through away a lot of vaccine    

So don't tell me there is a shortage if they are just throwing it away  How rediculous is this?

Everyone I've spoken to about this today is quite happy about the delays astutely recognizing that fewer fools will thus be led to the proverbial (and on occasion actual) slaughter  The delays will also allow time for Canadians to see that this virus like the great 'epidemic' diseases of the past will follow a natural rise-and-fall curve running out of steam without any (imagined) aid from vaccines

Can someone explain why GSK still has the sole-source contract for the vaccine? There are TEN companies making it after all?

We know the Liberals gave them the contract after a (coincidental I'm sure) $50000 donation to the Liberal party 

But why would the Tories those paragons of transparency and honesty in government keep it going? Could it be that Mr  Harper's best buddy is the lobbyist for GSK? Or that Mr  Harper has good friends on the board of GSK? Tell us it isn't so! Could the Tories be just a corrupt and self-serving as the Liberals?

Of course they are yet again to the detriment of the Canadian people  Because when the Liberals do it it's just money and mostly what they lose is trust  But when the Tories do it from the Avro to this vaccine thing Canada gets seriously damaged each and every time 

Tories destroying Canada one government at a time

R Miller1 anise seeds are a good thing to chew/swallow/masticate because it contains astringent qualities which may give throat-nasal bacteria a run for its money  It's qualities may also have some effect on airborne virii by creating a less=inviting environment in the throat/nasal passages 
It's not a wonder cure  Just a healthy thing to eat and an immunity booster

I have to say I was very surprised to find out that the adjuvant and the antigen come in separate vials  When GSK saod they had to make changes to the production line I assumed it was because they have to reformulate the vaccine 

It sounds like they only change the quantity of antigen and ship it without adjuvant  I don't understand why thta should cause such a huge delay 

I also don't understand why the press hasn't asked them

And the saga continues  Fools are being lead to the flu clinics with huge propaganda and scare tactics 

Educate yourself  don't believe big money machine run by Big Pharma with the help of WHO and local health authorities 

Just last week two young healthy nurses got flu shots (H1N1) here and both ended in hospital immediatelly and one of them has not fully recovered more than a week after 

Did you know what is in the soup called H1N1 vaccine? Full disclosure has never been given to anyone but it contains at least following incrediences according to Health Sciense Institute in Baltimore 

thimerosal (mercury deriviative as preservative)
formaldehyde (to kill viruses)
aluminium (to promote antibody response)
ethyl glycol (=antifreeze as disinfectant)

also I have heard from other sources that it contains shark fin oil and remains of chicken embrios from fertilized eggs  People allergic to sea food may get severe reaction and they have not been warned about it 

We will find out years from now what kind of neurological problems will emerge  People with epilepsy have been getting severe seizures from this soup  Check epilepsy forums if you have history of seizures

Of course people have been warned about it  It's on practically every bonafide public health site in the Western World for Christ's sake 

The shark oil is called squalene and is something your body naturally produces itself and regulates every damn day  It's been used in vaccines since 1997 with no reported adverse effects and greatly increase the effectiveness of the vaccine 

People with severe egg allergies that can lead to anaphylaxis have been told to steer clear of the vaccine as have people with autoimmune disorders 

1 in 100 000 people who get swine flu will be hospitalized possibly die or end up with lifelong complications 

1 in 1 000 000 people who get the vaccine will have serious complications but the risk of death is much lower 

One should plan accordingly

The adjuvant improves the effectiveness of the vaccine thus requiring less of the antigen while also requiring 1/10th the thimerasol 

It is made up of mostly vitamin E and squalene both of which your body regulates everyday 

There is every reason to believe despite a lack of longitudinal studies that it is as safe as any other vaccine and even more effective

I'm going to be ethical and do my duty by waiting until absolutely everyone who is more important than me has had their shot  Ditto for one of my at risk relatives  By the time they get around to us the crisis will be long over and we won't actually have to bother  What we have witnessed in this fiasco is a really clear example of lack of character and leadership among the suppposed elites in our society  I am glad I am not one of them  They can rationalize and justify their opportunism all they like they can push the babies and pregnant women out of their way as they stampede to the front of the line - I don't care  What they don't understand especially the board members of the hospitals is that most of us will never believe another word they have to say about anything  Next time there's a pandemic we will all just ignore them

The product monograph including a complete list of ingredients is available on the web  Google Arepanrix 

The vaccine licensed for use in Canada does not contain any aluminum or ethyl glycol  There are only trace amounts of formaldehyde in the product which is used to ensure the virus is non-infectious and cannot cause disease and removed prior to formulation  The amount of mercury in a single dose is equivalent to the amount in 2 5g of fresh or frozen tuna 

For those of you wearing them take off your aluminum-foil hats they're impairing brain function  There isn't any conspiracy

Philosopher King are you doing everything that health officials and doctors say? Have you ever thought why health officials and doctors do not take swine flu shots? Just ask yourself   
I'm not talking that this vaccination is very expensive

The test has to be sent to Winnipeg for confirmation of H1N1  Ontario's lab can only test for the regular flu 

~~

Officials in Ontario are asking doctors and hospitals to send swabs directly to the provincial lab 

The PCR test that the Ontario lab is currently using can show if the virus is influenza A but not if it is the H1N1 strain 

If we get an influenza A that's non-typeable that's the first clue that this probably is swine flu because regular seasonal flu should be easily typeable said Gardam 

Those initial results are sent to Winnipeg where the national lab performs a further PCR test to confirm the presence of swine flu  Gardam said the whole process from swab to confirmation from Winnipeg can take up to five days

Amazing   it's a sad commentary on our society when there are more conspiracy theorists commenting on the article about the possible H1N1 shortage than are commenting on this article 

My deepest and heartfelt condolences go out the Mr  Frustaglio family  I have a little boy and could not imagine the pain they are going through right now  May the Lord help you and your family find some comfort in this toughest of times 

Reports that the boy had a touch of asthma are irresponsible and a WEAK attempt at deflecting the responsibility for this tragedy  I had asthma as a boy and can confirm this   you don't have a TOUCH of asthma

One word: Retail  Where is the front lines of any sickness that can be passed on in these ways it's the retail world  And who are the majority in the retail world? Women and young women at that probably  If you want to protect society in a pandemic make sure the malls and grocery stores and plazas are well protected  The amount of people who cough or sneeze on their hands and then give you money a second later is appalling  These things spread because of the laziness of the people and the unfortunate presence of a large portion of the pop  on the front lines

A while back the Star had an article regarding cases in Ontario as of mid July  There were about three hundred plus identified cases in Ontario  Of those about 5 6 % died  That's pretty high  Don't fool yourself this could get really nasty  The story starts out with once admitted to hospital require rapid admittance to critical care and aggressive treatment  Is that likely to happen with all the closings of hospitals and reductions of services? We are already at a huge disadvantage to manage an outbreak if one were to occur  Or we could just stick our heads in the sand and pretend this is nothing more than fear mongering

People should take a lesson from Bill Maher: There is no money is healthy people there is no money in dead people  The money is in sick people  He goes on to talk about why there is still no cure for cancer and AIDS after billions and billions of dollars have been put into research  You're telling me we can put men on the moon but can't cure cancer? He is absolutely right! I am sure there will soon be a drug for H1N1 that will make the drug companies more money

RE: proud Canuck

Ever check the mortality rate of seasonal flu? It is about 5%  --Is it? Recent articles have stated that h1n1 'may' not be any worse that the seasonal flu (as you stated) which has a death rate of less than 0 1 percent (so then isn't the 5 6 % seen in the Ontario cases high?)  I guess it all depends on the care you get  Read the Star story where a number of 'known' infections in Ontario resulted in a 'known' number of deaths  In these cases the victims did indeed get hospital treatment as the first paragraph of this article states is required  The reality is in Ontario that our hospitals won't likely be able to handle it  So while the norm may be less than  1 percent can Ontario handle it? Will Ontario be above or below the norm  There will be highs and lows where some regions will do better than others  How will Ontario do?

Nice try wc but the mortality rate for seasonal influenza outbreaks is not even remotely close to 5%  An infectious disease with a communicability rate of the flu (about 15 - 20%) and with a mortality rate of 5% would be a public health disaster  Those that die from it are almost invariably elderly or immune compromised  When it comes to H1N1 it is younger healthy people who are most at risk  It is also interesting to note that the influenza mortality rate in Ontario dropped between 57% and 74% since the introduction of universial vaccination in 2000  The number of people on this site who want to play osterich and just pretend that there is no risk is astounding  Burying your head in the sand and pretending that there is no pandemic won't protect you  Your ridiculous and unsubstantiated claims about the safety and effectiveness of vaccines are both dangerous and foolish  Vaccine development has saved more lives than any other single medical advance

What useless flu shot? The flu shot that Ontario gives every year that reduced influenza mortality in the province by between 54% and 75? Stop spreading lies and misinformation about the safety and effectiveness of vaccines  If you want to trust your own health to your own uneducated views that's your choice but you should at least have the decency not to put others at risk if they aren't smart enough to ignore your advice and listen to the experts instead

Actually Mantis   

the seasonal mortality rate IS around five percent  I work in a healthcare facility and receive the daily outbreak report from Toronto Public Health  Regular seasonal flu outbreaks are extremely common as are the deaths of people who have the flu plus additional co-morbidities  Although not the case in the greater community at large within healthcare facilities the seasonal flu IS considered a public health disaster  There are strict reporting guidelines and aggresive actions taken to prevent spread  Toronto Public Health is involved and isolation procedures put in place until TPH gives the all clear  Although I agree in theory with the rest of your post I didn't see the need to denigrate another poster for posting an accurate statistic

Conspiracy? I wouldn’t dream of it…but…here in Canada the vaccine companies can't be sued for any side effects the vaccines cause nor in the US  Why? If the vaccine is so damn safe then why would all G8 governments protect huge corporate conglomerate pharmaceutical vaccine companies from potential lawsuits?    Duuuuuuuuuh… The H1N1 vaccine is going to be laced with the mercury containing preservative thimerosal  That's right the same thimerosal that was banned in influenza vaccines in California and several other states starting in 2004  The reason? The mercury-laden toxin has been linked to a number of health concerns -- including worries thimerosal caused or contributed to the current autism epidemic  It also contains squalene which has conclusively linked to Guillain-Barr? syndrome  US gov’t in the 1976 swine flu vaccine debacle doled out 3 5 billion in lawsuits to people who suffered the side effects of taking the vaccine  Definitely no conspiracy…yea right…

There most certainly is a pandemic  Mortality is not part of the criteria used in determining a pandemic  The one and only factor used in determining a panedmic is spread  A pandemic is defined as the community based spread of an infectious agent in two or more separate geographic areas simultaneously  The H1N1 virus is spreading globally and therefore we have a pandemic  Whether it kills 100% of those it infects or whether it makes you live to be 100 it doesn't matter  It has nothing to do with determining a pandemic

Can our system handle the caseload?

Here's an excerpt from the CTV version of this story --- Dr  Anand Kumar of St  Boniface Hospital in Winnipeg Manitoba who led the Canadian study told Reuters that swine flu is one of the most difficult conditions he's ever had to treat  Kumar said he normally sees only a few patients a year who become severely ill from the flu  But at one point in Winnipeg during the spring 50 per cent of the available ICU beds in the city were filled with H1N1 patients all struggling for their lives simultaneously  http://toronto ctv ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20091012/healthy_women_swine_091012/20091012/?hub=TorontoNewHome Yes that was 50% of the ICU beds had H1N1 patients in them according to the doctor who headed the study

RE: Actully Mantis

Joan there seems to be some issue with the numbers here  According to a Rueters story The Pandemic Severity Index set by the U S  government has five categories of pandemic with a category 1 being comparable to a seasonal flu epidemic  Seasonal flu has a death rate of less than 0 1 percent -- but still manages to kill 250000 to 500000 people globally every year  A category 5 pandemic would compare to the 1918 flu pandemic which had an estimated death rate of 2 percent or more and would kill tens of million of people  http://www reuters com/article/healthNews/idUSTRE58E6NZ20090916 If we in Canada are seeing a 5% mortality rate would that not suggest we have a higher rate than many other countries?

We should be fine!

I think if we wash our hands regularly (before and after eating after handling money or shaking someone's hands) we should be fine  Eat sleep and exercise well too! Give the body's immune system a chance to do its job! The sudden hype surrounding the swine flu should at least make people skeptical about the whole thing no?

Pandemic Definitions

The WHO defines it one way the FDA another The word conjures images of basically everyone sick at some point  Did anyone look at the map on The Star site regarding H1N1 cases? And that they are dwindling? When we are told to expect a rebound? Please everyone just wash your hands like you usually do and everything will be just fine

re: mea culpa

I just noticed your statement on mortality rate  You are correct  Mortality rate is a measure of the number of deaths due to a specific cause per unit time  That is the number of deaths per 1000 individuals per year - infected or not  The second wave? It could be good it could be bad but Chief Public Health Officer Dr  David Butler-Jones was quoted as saying A second wave of the H1N1 flu virus could affect upwards of 35 per cent of the population which is three to four times the typical seasonal flu rate http://www healthedition com/  Maybe those numbers are way to high but as Dr  Kumar said he normally only sees a few sick enough to hospitalize but during the spring half his ICU beds were filled with H1N1 cases  For all our sakes let's hope you are right but if you aren't it's going to be a hell of a flu season

Since people in their 30s are at such a high risk of dying should they not be at the top of the list for the vaccine? Would it not make sense to be proactive with this group rather than reactive?

Keeping Count

How can the government keep proper records when they (Federal not Provincial) have decided that they will no longer test patients for H1N1 unless they have been hospitalized? Does this not sound similar to the SARS fiasco which resulted from the Ontario CRAP government not wanting to spend money to ensure that SARS was contained? The only way anyone can be certain that someone has H1N1 is for them to be tested  Perhaps our federal government doesn't want us to panic over an H1N1 pandemic? Or maybe they feel the mortality rate doesn't justify the cost of confirming cases  Whatever the reasoning testing isn't a luxury but rather a necessity  Shame on whomever made this ridiculous decision

and here is a real scenario     

Our 11 year old daughter returned last week from one of those Grade 6 camps       within a day high fever and the works  Normally we wait a few days before going to the doctor but we knew this was serious  Doctor advised that based on symptoms likely H1N1 but they do not devote the resources to testing anymore per the Ontario Government(so there is the answer on the count)     we can bring her back in a few days if no improvement and THEN they may test her for it     so tonnes of meds and puffers etc  Now I am getting sick -- if I at least knew whether she had it or not it would make feel a lot better either way as I could go to Emergency now and wait for it but instead I will wait it out and see what happens  Funny when McFibber jacked our taxes up $900 each per year forever for health the last thing I thought would be there would be no resources for a basic test during a pandemic for a patient that shows all the signs/symptoms of the H1N1

treatment is the same

there is a lot of discussion about testing but you have to ask yourself what testing is going to accomplish - for most people the answer is NOTHING  Treatment does not change whether it is H1N1 another strain or influenza or the common cold  Yes there is the option of Tamiflu - BUT it must be taken within the first 48 hrs of symptoms and the guidelines DO NOT recommend the use of Tamiflu for those that are otherwise healthy  So why spend/waste healthcare dollars to test for H1N1 only to get the results back after you have already recovered anyway and the treatment is not going to change  If you had to pay for the test you would ask yourself what are you gaining from knowing the results  And in most of the population the answer is nothing  So I applaud the recommendations to not do widespread testing  piepants please re-read the H1N1pamphlet- it is only the seasonal flu vaccine thats initially only being offered to those 65 and older but the H1N1 is offered to everyone

My story  

About five or six weeks ago a girl at my work was admitted to hospital and eventually it was confirmed as H1N1  She was very very sick but has since recovered  She had to move hospitals because the place she went to the ER didn't have a critical care bed for her  In the week that followed her illness about thirty other employees (more than half of the workplace) including myself developed the flu and were out of work for about 5-7 days each  None of the rest of us were sick enough to require hospitalization so we have no idea if we had H1N1 or not although it would certainly appear we did  I have recovered but the 7 days I was sick I was VERY sick  It was also crazy to see how fast it spread through the workplace - it took 3 days for about 50% of the employees in our department to get sick with seasonal flu it never seems to be that bad  I do hope that the government has enough beds ventilators staff etc ready should more people require them

Basic Reading Comprehension Would Help Here    

No it is not those only over 65 receiving H1N1 vaccine those over 65 will be offered the SEASONAL VACCINE first as they are more susceptible  And no as we know that 99% of the influenza circulating now is H1N1 is does not make sense for scarce lab resources to be testing just assume that it is H1N1 - and take the usual measures that you would for any flu  While 30-somethings are at a highter risk for dying of H1N1 which is a hallmark of a pandemic influenza the mortality rate is still infintesimally small

@ CHARR RE: Treatment is the same

treatment is the same you wrote whether H1N1 or normal influenza  Really???? I wonder why every news channel has as its lead story tonight that the mean (as in a statistical average and not one's temperment in case you did not know) age of an H1N1 patient is 32 and the intensive care units of hospitals will be overwhelmed because of the low oxygen levels in blood casued by H1N1 resulting in the need for direct oxygen intake (masks)  I did not realize that this was a normal thing and this is how the normal influenza is treated     wow thanks for educating us  I suggest you leave medicine to medical professionals      nothing personal but you should not be printing such inaccuracies when people reading your blogs have loved ones diagnosed with H1N!

Pandemic?

Right  Tamiflu stock soars media attention is diverted  What I want to know is what is going on behind the scenes right now that they want our attention diverted to a non-existent pandemic  (as in 36000 a year die of flu already  not to feel not sorry for those who have passed by swine flu   Could have been frog flu and would make no difference)  Is there something cooking with the Big3 auotmakers orhave we forgotten already is there a genocide somewhere? (yes   but there is the flu ya know) is there a war going on? Between the Pirates and the Flu any real coverage in the world is nicely hidden  Think about the hidden agenda behind this campaign  Obviously tamiflu holders will line their pockets (yes yes huges US politicians hold monstrous tamiflu stock) but that's not the new here  Sensational news like this is used to divert attention at key times    Betcha there was a WTO meeting gong on somewhere   The WHO?

Propaganda

This is going to be another excuse to raise the price of pork  Scarcity make prices increase  I predict that the pork industry will have to start destroying stocks of pork in order to deter the spread of the virus  In doing so there will be less stock which is in fact an illusion because the grocery shelves always have the product  The thing is when the prices increase they almost never decrease proportionately  I remember when Mad Cow and Foot and Mouth diseases were an issue  The price of beef and dairy went up dramatically  Then Mercury in Sammon   same deal  Bird Flu   yup cost of poultry went up  I think it's propaganda so they can raise the price of pork above the rate of inflation to systematically increase the cost of living

What are you talking about???? What deregulation? What this story shows is why farmers do not want anyone just showing up at their farms  This shows that this farm workers shouldn't have been allowed to go back to work but most likely wasn't aware of any risk because this happened early into the flu's warnings  He was already back at work before the warning went out  This article shows that farmers are virulent when it comes to protecting their herds  The pigs have been quarantined and all necessary actions have been to taken to prevent any spreading to other farms  These pigs do not be need to be slaughtered as their meat doesn't pose a risk to humans when cooked properly  I don't know of anyone foolish enough to eat raw pork do you? So what deregulation are you talking about?

Why havnt we seen any players step back and say this isnt right?

Just because they are at high risk of getting the flue doesnt mean they are at high risk of dieing from it  Can't these guys think for themselves?

Wow 

I am speechless  My own daughter who is high risk because of asthma has not been able to get her shot and these knuckle heads get to jump the line because they play sports? Wow  This shows us where our priorities are  These guys are obviously much more important! Wow  How can they say there was no preferential treatment?

Professional atheletes generate huge amounts of revenue for this city  If they are sick no revenue  My ability to work is important to my employer so they flew me to the USA to get a flu shot there because MY CANADIAN government could not do the job

Special privileges

So Deb Matthews is 'outraged' and plans to look into the matter  While she's 'looking into' this little scandal perhaps she could look into how Leafs and Raptors can get instant MRIs while ordinary Ontarioans wait weeks  And next time you see a Leaf get helped off the ice and hear he is going to hospital for tests ask yourself if he sits in Emergency for 6-8 hours when he gets to hospital  Tell me again that we don't have two tier medical care in Ontario

Money really can buy you anything!! If I had millions of dollars in the bank it sure would suck to die of H1N1  Its all about money isnt that why we have a shortage of the vaccine right now cause the company the Canadian government us buying from is selling it off at a higher price to someone else!

Professional athletes come into contact with a LOT of people every single day  Let's not forget that they are constantly traveling are in and out of airports on almost a daily basis in arenas with tens of thousands of people and in the cases of some approached for autographs and photos when out in public  I would say that it is a pretty high priority that these gentlemen get vaccinated

As somebody who stood in line and witnessed the chaos confusions people succumbing to the bitter cold- I can't begin to convey how angry I am after learning that pro athletes were given preferential treatment over pregnant mothers children and people with underlying health problems  Somebody need to get sack over this fiasco  Pro athletes and their family's health is no more or less important than the health my kids and the millions of other Canadian's family  I don't really blame the athletes themselves the blame lies to whoever let them jump the queue  What making this worst now for the athletes and their organizations is that they are trying to justify their queue jumping with stupid nonsense  I am a trucker I deal with millions fo people daily too and I travel the throught 4 province and 3 states every week  I am not getting a shot nor did I want one ahead of the who deserve it more  Somebody need to be held accountable PERIOD

But this is how it always worked  Just try to get an MRI in under four months but if the little star gets hurt in last night's game he'll have an MRI before the game is over  Don't get me started an a private clinic with very few high risk patients receiving 3000 doses before doctors or clinics in the public domain get any at all!

I can't begin to explain how frustrated I get with politicians and their double talk  She says she is outraged over the pro sports teams getting the vaccine  Well what about the city of toronto giving 3000 doses to that exclusive clinic  If she is so outraged at the sports teams getting the vaccine then one would then she would come down like the fist of god on the toronto officials responsible  Why don't they take over the city of toronto innoculation cites where hundreds of non-priority people are jumping the line?

Really can't see how this is okay 

I am a BIG Leafs fan and while I wouldn't want anybody to be bed-ridden or worse by H1N1 or any other infection there is no way you can convince me that these hockey players receiving the flu shot before large numbers of identified priority groups is okay  The decision to have the Leafs and Marlies jump the queue is mostly financial one  The arguments about the leafs being public figures with lots of contact with fans and flying frequently etc  and thus needing to have the shot are all just window dressing to the real financial reasons they got it  I work at an agency where therapists work with autistic children who have little to no understanding or care for universal precautions  These people are having kids spit cough and sneeze directly in their face regularly and without warning  However they are not identified as a priority group  Something is really wrong here

The Hockey Players

are at risk as well  Yes I concede what the Health official did was incorrect by giving them special treatment but they are at risk just like the elderly and the babies     just because they're athletes doesn't mean they have excellent immune systems  They travel all over the country and the states to play hockey games and they interact with people who may have the swine flu and didn't know they were contagious  They can contract it anywhere and bring it back to Canada and their families  Why shouldn't they be vaccinated? The same way the PM must have gotten his and his family's swine flu shotsand they (possibly) fall into the group that is ineligible due to their ages     we shouls think about that

Protecting their investment

I'm wondering if it's so much the players themselves desiring the vaccination or the owners/operators of these big franchises trying to protect their investment and encouraging their players to get vaccinated  I don't agree with them jumping the line (ahead of priority groups) but I can also see where this might be big business trying to protect their profit

We are ALL responsible

As i read these comments and others around the H1N1 virus and lack of doses I cannot help but to think back a few weeks ago and remember seeing the lines of people waiting to get their shot  How many people were in those lines that were NOT in the Priority Groups ? I was quite appaled at watching that and yet those peopel were still getting the shots  Perhaps those people should have been turned away and we whould not have the shortage we have now  There was lots of notice as to who was in the priority groups and yet people still went and got their shot even though they should note have  We ONLY have ourselves to blame for not following Gov't guidlines (and who knows those Leaf & Raptors players may have just waiting 3 or 4 hours in line)  Wait for facts before making comments

Priority Groups

As for the outsider observing those in line for the vaccination what does a person who has a chronic medical condition (like asthma diabetes cancer) or a health care worker or a care provider (of an infant under 6mo of age or persons who may not respond to vaccines) who is under 65yr of age look like? Would they not look like you or I? I wouldn't be one to judge; if they waited >3hr to get the vaccine they probably needed it

Why won't any politician admit it    

that we already have two tiered health care  The second tier has always been available to the super rich and it always will  The refusal to open up the health care system and allow a supposed alternative really only hurts the majority of people who can't afford to pay the sky high prices that this second tier currently forces you to pay  We are forced into a medioce health system or you can pay thru the nose and go down to the US or thru other extremely pricey methods here in Canada  So cut me the fake outrage Deb and tell us the truth instead of slathering on the good intentions  After all isnt' that what the path to hell is paved with?

what is unexpected about this   

yes there are so-called priority groups that should receive the vaccine first however those with money rank and privilege will always trump those without  It has been that way throughout history and will always be  No doubt there will be other reports of people jumping the queue  All people are equal but some are more equal than others    FWIW I have no plans to get vaccinated so perhaps someone who feels they need it and really wants it can have mine instead

First this is not political or partisan its the flu people get a grip  Second if people want to blame someone blame your doctor or yourself  I'm not getting the shot but my buddy went with his dad to their family doctor and received the vac a week ago Their doctor had ordered a supply imagine that! Last of course MLSE provided the shot  They likely paid GlaxoSmithKLine for it just like they pay to have an MRI for an injured player  STOP BLAMING GOVERNMENT FOR ALL YOUR WOES IN LIFE!!!

I lined up with my 3 year old as he is in the priority group  However there were lots of families getting them together (father mother son daughter grandfather grandmother cousin uncle etc   )  Most dont seem to care that there is a shortage and some people do need it before others   try to talk to these people about it and they tell you to mind your own business   people dont care about that so why should we care about a few famous people

Logic

Why would any government employee or politician be upset over this? Logic would dictate that anyone playing the highest marginal tax rate are the most important to keep healthy as they’re the ones ultimately paying the salaries of said employees; not to mention footing the bill for the heath care system they’re accused of exploiting  When will Atlas Shrug?

Please Some Calm

Well no westender if I had the money and connections these people seem to have I wouldn't have gotten the shot  Not for myself or for my family  There hasn't been enough study for adults and there hasn't been any study for children under the age of eighteen  If everyone would take a deep breath and the media would stop whipping the masses into a panicked frenzy everyone would feel much better  Children dying is a tragedy I humbly submit however that more people die every single day from medical incompetance than they do of H1N1

Who cares

I think I speak for the vas majority of the general public when I say WHO CARES  Really this isn’t anything anyone should be making a big deal about  Pro athletes travel more then the majority of the general public which in turn would put them at a larger risk on coming in counter of the virus  This whole thing isn’t a pandemic at this point so lets all just relax  So a few people have died this happens sometimes  Once the numbers are in the hundreds per province then we can all start to make a huge federal case of who got there shots first and why  Until then let’s try to stay level headed and worry about ourselves and reading real news

Business as usual

Not to sound (too) cynical but how is this even news? Is anyone really that surprised that rich well-connected athletes got preferential treatment? They've been receiving special treatment ever since they played Bantam  There was an article in this paper yesterday about expensive private clinics providing the vaccine to patients who can afford to pay  Is it right? Of course not  But it's definitely par for the course  I'm going to save my moral outrage for the next Star article about government consultants who expense Timbits

So what   

You are all a bunch of hypocrites  The shots were supposed to be given to the priority groups first  But it is obvious that the majority of people who were in those lineups were NOT from the priority groups  They are the real que jumpers who were completely selfish and thought about no one but themselves  The result is the shortage of the vaccine because selfish healthy Canadians did not have the patience to wait their turn  All of you are making scapegoats of the athletes yet you turn a blind eye to the tens of thousands of selfish people jumped the que and pushed the priority groups to the back of the line

    Canada tends to export pigs much more than import them  Pigs are generally raised in warm dry barns with adequate and highquality feed and constant available clean water to drink  They are protected from rain and snow and hot sun  They are watched for signs of illness and then treated appropriately 

    Probably some of the farms seen in the USA showed pigs forced to wallow around in mud puddles outdoors or in tiny little uninsulated rickety shacks and sheds with dirt floors  Likely forced to eat grass and straw and root around in the dirt ingesting all kinds of harmful bugs and microbes instead of highquality and tasty clean grain with adequate protein and vitamins  It is uncommon to find that type of pig farms in Canada anymore

    Congratulations Mr  Granastein on getting your shot  I wonder if your priority status had anything to do with your job description  Just a thought 
    As for private clinics it's not that they distribute the vaccine it's that public dollars were used to buy it but that a private service distributed it to private payers  Making up for the public relations nightmare now doesn't change what happened 
    If we all pay for it and it's in limited supply then there needs to be central distribution that respects who is high need and who isn't  Maybe the next Smart Systems / eHealth will figure it out over a billion or so of our cash

    Hey Frank  She didn't refuse the vaccine  People like my wife should have been fast tracked past all of the people using their kids to get shots of their own and past healthy people who found a way to declare themselves a priority  I was one of the healthy people and had no intention of getting the shot  I have since had H1N1 myself and it is just like they say       mild flu like symptoms 

    And as for you Richard       you are probably correct  No argument here  I stand by my comments however that a lot of people in the line were looking out for good old no  1 and were not in any way people who were priority candidates for the flu shot

    Don't be so quick to blame the Flames  At the time they were treated Alberta was giving the shots to anyone who showed up at a clinic  No preference yet for high risk groups and no mention of shortages  Premier Ed proclaimed that the vaccine was for ALL Albertans  The Flames organization called and asked if a clinic could be set up and they were told YES  They could have been told no  Why would they think anything was wrong? Then the news of shortages comes out and the politicians panic  The people fired were scapegoats because the politicians were getting too much flack about que jumping  Does anyone really believe that these indignant politicians were going to line up for hours with the peasants when their time came? Not likely

This all goes back to poor planning and execution  That's the leadership that the federal government should be providing and isn't  Instead every municipality and province are making things up as they go  No individual should be punished for the screwed up system  Last week the issue was not the amount of vaccine but capacity to deliver it  Report this comment!report this comment

Call a spade a spade  It was jumping the line  The criteria for determining your risk is your level of danger from actually the virus not if you are around people  That excludes professional atheletes IMO  Go Oilers Report this comment!report this comment

I see how some players may be able to jump line much like myself to be honest  I have a 2 year old daughter who is very suseptible to things like this due to a medical condition  Everyone in our household got to jump to the front of the line  I am sure that some players will fall into this area as well  Overall can't say I blame the players here I think administration has a role to play here  If someone offered it to them it may have cost them their job but it isn't like you can take it back now  It is done  Report this comment!report this comment

I'm high risk because we share the same water bottles or travel together and can't get away from the others  Give me a break  It just shows the level of intelligence an NHL player has  It is a known fact children are more acceptable and are at a higher risk to turn fatal if they contract the H1N1  Also in the news lately there is a shortage and the vaccine would be administrated in a manner of the high risk first (depending your province)  Maybe the Hockey players can turn their TV's from the toon network to the news channel  Report this comment!report this comment

These players logic as to why they feel they are entitled to getting the shot ahead of other people is almost more insulting than sneaking around to get it in the first place  There are a lot of professions that have a contact with alot of people  Think of anyone who serves the public works in retail at restaurants and teachers  If they are at least admiting that they took advantage of their celebrity status I could at respect the honesty  Report this comment!report this comment

I usually try to add some humour to any comment I submit to TSN  This is a difficult task today  Brian Burke needs to re-assess his definition of vulnerable  In the case of pro-hockey athletes it does NOT mean a group of players who are at risk of not winning another game this year  When I was in grade school truculent aggressive people were the ones who among other things used to butt in line  We called them bullies  '   players   did as they were told - there was no intention of cutting ahead of anyone ' BUT YOU DID! And I'll be just as shocked and angry if it comes to light that my team the Canadiens have done the same thing  Report this comment!

I don't blame the players but whoever is supplying them with the vaccine should be punished  The players may be at an elevated risk to become infected but they are not at an elevated risk of dying  That is the difference  The players shouldn't need to defend themselves about this  The teams should be telling them not to comment  The provincial health ministries and local health authorities should be answering the question: 'How are pro athletes receiving the vaccine instead of the high priority citizens as defined by you?'

What a silly argument for these athletes to be put at higher risk  I play rec hockey and am at the same water bottle risk  I travel in a carpool and teach at a school with hundreds of children and travel to various schools substituting in contact with many coughing kids  I would argue that these athletes have access to a doctor 24/7 unlike the rest of us in this country  One sniffle and the team doctor is there for them  If I sniffle I have to wait a month to see a doctor  We went several months without a family doctor because there is a shortage in the country  As far as 'you'd do the same thing too if you had the chance to get your shot'  What bunk  I could have jumped the line but didn't  The decent human being would have waited until the kids had the shots  Some role models these players are  I've lost some respect  Either they are arrogant and selfish for what they have done or they are just stupid to not realize they are jumping the line  Report this comment!report this comment

Is anyone else getting really tired of this? We need a couple of really big trades to talk about  As long as it's not one guy with H1N1 for another  Geez    OK so have all the players in the NHL been getting the regular flu shot for the last 20 years? Have we seen teams go through bouts with the flu over the years? Yes  Has it been widespread amongst the team? No  Usually if not always it's just a couple guys  When are these guys immune systems compromised? They're pro athletes they eat well sleep well drink mega fluids  Today more than ever pro athletes are hyper-conscious of good health practices  Do a lot of them have underlying health issues that could lead to complications from influenza? I've never heard of a pro hockey player dying from the flu  They may be susceptible to getting it in theory but they're certainly not in any danger of dying from its complications because this flu is no more dangerous in fact less than Influenza A  If every year they publicized every death from Influenza A there would be widespread panic all the time  36000 deaths a year in the US related to the flu  The ONLY complication you can die from is pneumonia when there are underlying cardiopulmonary or other respiratory conditions and proper care is not given  Hey more people die from malpractice than cancer every year  Fact  Report this comment!report this comment

Professional athletes (especially hockey players in this country) are celebrities and as such receive innumerable advantages over 'the rest of us'  Their wealth and fame allow them to bypass the traditional inconveniences of everyday life and this is no exception  If the issue is that they skipped the line; why is anyone surprised? More importantly why is anyone outraged? This is standard celebrity treatment  If the issue is that these athletes have access to vaccines they aren't eligible to receive that's a different story (but not altogether that different)  I find all of this outrage rather comical not to mention ironic  It's the mothers who buy Hello Magazine and the fathers who wait three hours in line to have some third liner sign a jersey for their kid that have created this situation; not the athletes or government  Report this comment!report this comment

These hockey players need to think before they speak  Yes I suppose they are indeed high risk of transmitting the flu to each other but they are not 'high risk' by the true definition of the term  'High risk' means high risk of complications like the very young the very old those with chronic health conditions and those with depressed immune systems for staters  The way I see it from an Oilers point of view Fernando Pisani would likely be eligible for the shot due to his 1)chronic condition of Crohn's disease and 2) the fact he is likely taking immunosuppressing drugs for this disease  I sincerely doubt any other Oiler would fit the bill as high risk and unless they are they should keep their traps shut  Go Oil!

fanfare - Do you realise a pro athlete or traveler has the potential to infect thousands of high-risk people per day anywhere in North America? Sure it's get that high risk people get the shot but if no one around them has the flu virus to begin with you'll be saving more people  Like I said in a previous post what if a team of pro athletes visits a hospital full of sick kids and one (or more) of those athletes is unknowingly carrying the virus? What if a pro athlete unknowingly carrying the virus gets on a plane wiht 200+ other people maybe 50 of which are high-risk? Just think of how many people can become infected  Just one shot to an athlete can PREVENT the flu virus being transmitted to tens of thousands of high-risk people  Report this comment!report this comment

These players ARE high risk  Both for spreading and contracting  They are high risk to all of us! Anyone who travels they way they do should be getting the vaccine  You can bet any government official that travels across our borders has already had the shots  The travel aspect is exactly how this virus is spread  This is how they contain exposure  This is a smart move  You need to stop thinking these people are spoiled celebrities and really think about what's going on here  This is as good for you as it is for them  I am not a celebrity I have no ability to jump the queue but I for one am happy that those who have jobs that put themselves and by extension me and my family at risk are being vaccinated  Report this comment!report this comment

How on earth can hockey teams consider themselves high bloody risk?!?!?! Scholl kids are together WAYYY more than hockey players  They share wayyyy more than hockey players  And they are KIDS!!!! Any hockey player who has had the shot should be bloody ashamed of themselves for taking something that should have gone to a child  Our children matter more than us! If you don't believe that then you shouldn't have children!!!!! Report this comment!report this comment

The sad part about this is that the government takes opportunities like this to deflect as much attention as possible away from the fact that they dropped the ball big time with H1N1  How long have we all known about H1N1? seems like at least a year to me   yet for some reason we are still comming up short on the amount of vaccinations available for everyone??? Bottome line there shouldn't have been a 'priority list' to begin with and we all should have had the same access to the vaccination  Report this comment!report this comment

This is the bottom line - despite their heroics on the field and in the arenas these pro athletes that queue jumped are cowards  There is a huge difference between having high risk to get the flu (just about ANY teacher) compared to dying from the flu  Healthy strong athletes who are not high risk of dying from the flu who jump ahead of 5 year-olds and people with serious medical issues to get a potentially life saving short supply shot are COWARDS  These are the same people who would hiding in the barracks during a fire fight or push the women and children to the floor so they can get off the sinking boat first  It is sad  These athletes may have been told what to do but where is the individual making a selfless decision and putting those at risk of dying first?

How is athletes 'jumping the line' for the flu shot any different than how they manage to regularly 'jump the line' to get MRI scans or surgeries that the public have to wait forever for??    hell it takes 3-4 weeks just to get a family doctor's appt if you're lucky enough to have one - by then you're either cured or dead     Report this comment!report this comment

I don't have a position on the ethics surrounding this issue  Given the way the media has blown the H1N1 out of proportion combined with the Government's (and I mean all the parties) lack of foresight in ensuring more than 1 supplier of the vaccine we wouldn't have this debate  Are the players at more risk? Perhaps not but if one of them catches it that player could conceivably spread it around not only to other players people in the airports airplane personel hotel staff arena staff restaurant servers   the list goes on and on  Remember someone with H1N1 is infectious at least 24 hours PRIOR to showing any symptoms  As for it being a mild version  My wife is just getting over it today and I can tell you personally I have been because there is so little you can do other than treat the symptoms  Report this comment!report this comment

if so many players get the h1n1 virus which results in the cancelation of a game that means all that money is lost all those people dont go to work at the arena and the same as the other team  If calgary cant go play a game in detroit that means detroit doesn't play and all those people dont go to work at the joe louis  These players should definately get the flu shots being in contact with so many fans if your at the game do you want to contratc the flu from an infected player Report this comment!report this comment

uhv2luvtheraps - The purpose of a vaccine is to stimulate the body's immune system to recognize the agent (in this case H1N1) as foreign destroy it and 'remember' it so that the immune system can more easily recognize and destroy any of these microorganisms that it later encounters  Assuming the vaccine works as it is supposed to then should you as a vaccinated individual come into contact with the virus your immune system would destroy it  You would not actually develop the virus nor would you pass it on  Everyone is focusing on blaming the teams for jumping the lines etc  Put the blame where it actually belongs - your Federal MP for not ensuring that there would be enough vaccine available  This is not rocket science  The whole world knew this was coming a long ago and simply did not show any foresight  Typical but true nonetheless  There should have been at least two and actually three suppliers  One to prepare the vaccines for pregnant women two to prepare vaccines for the general population against both H1N1 and this year's Influenza  Report this comment!report this comment

lorne-t has it right uhv2luvtheraps  When injected the vaccine activates the body's immune system to produce antibodies that kill the flu virus if the recipient is exposed  IMO people that are more likely to be exposed to the virus (and in that I include not only public health workers but also travelers) can go a long way to STOP the spread of the virus by being immunized  I don't care if a player gets sick  I wouldn't care if pro sports is shut down for the duration of the flu season  If it stops them from potentially spreading this virus (as a result of greater exposure to it) then I'm all for it  it's time we stop thinking about how a few hundred doses (out of millions of doses) effects my aunt who is waiting in line because she MIGHT contract it and start thinking about how to prevent multiple healthy carriers who have far greater potential exposure to the virus from SPREADING it even further  It is a larger more comprehensive effort  We have to stop being so myopic about this  Even if their intention had nothing to do with the big picture  Even if all they cared about was themselves it will benefit all of us  We need to stop whining and get with the program  Report this comment!report this comment

The fact is the government was too stupid to put a restriction on who gets the shots first  If they had come out and said kids 0-10yrs this week 11-20yrs next week etc then it wouldnt have been a problem and we wouldnt be having this conversation  Unfortunately they tried to rely on human intelligence and compassion and it backfired  The sad truth is in reality it is every person for themselves  You may not agree with it but its the truth  People will place themselves and their families ahead of others every single time  If they came to YOUR door today and offered the vaccine to you and your family im positive you would not turn it down even though others are waiting for it  Report this comment!report this comment

I agree that the players aren't the only ones jumping the line  I'm sure friends and family members of some healthcare workers around the country managed to get the flu shot early too but since this was publicized it's easy to dismiss the rest and target these specific individuals  What's frustrating is to know that there are healthcare workers who approve these preferential treatments when they well know that other people are more at risk  But you have to wonder if there wasn't some back-scratching involved here too  I wouldn't expect the health department to say yes right away and set up the clinic just because it's the Flames that requested it  Maybe some free tickets were involved I don't know  Anyways the problem here too is that people got greedy  It wasn't enough to just get doses for the players they had to get enough for their families too  So now instead of getting 30 doses you end up with probably 100  In the end it's easier to judge people in this case because lives are at stake but how many of us have used company resources for our own benefits or seen off-duty police officers (for example) speed and called it 'perks-of-the-job'  It's human nature to take advantage of these situations and as appalling as it is since lives are on the line you can't really be surprised that this happened  Report this comment!report this comment

Ummmm being part of an NHL is a remote community isolated from others hard to get into and carry higher risk of obtaining the virus from the above daily social gatherings  NHL players connect w over 50% of the Canadian population at some point throughout the year and having these guys carry around H1N1 is crazy Ethically speaking the NHL should have received the vaccine for all teams to have but it was never thought of bc Gary B is well   ya…anyway gov't officials will never be able to over power a sports franchise over something like this bc when you proclaim that people in need of the vaccine need it most your excluding all the people who have a right to have the vaccine  Sports teams should be #1 on that list due to the fact that 100% of these players 1) Drink out of the same water bottle  2) travel together 3) spit together 4) etc…get the drift Report this comment!

First off players didn't 'jump' ahead in the line - they were offered the shot and took it  Second some companies and all major sports teams pay HUGE health insurance premiums for the health services they get (which is why they get treatment when they need it  That unfortunately is part of capitalism - if you don't like it move to Iran ) Lastly approx  50% of a players' salary is put back into all forms of government due to taxes which is obviously millions of dollars a year  So don't complain that they get preferential treatment since they helped pay for your flushot  Report this comment!report this comment

Good grief  They make it sound like a hockey player too the needle out of the hand of an elderly person or infant  Did those people who got sick and died stand in line for a shot and it wasn't available or something? I have yet to hear new of someone becoming ill or passing due to the shortage  And the clowns on here commenting only add to the media fire  Get off your arses and go stand in line if you want it  Don't sit at your computer and bellyache about how much some guy makes etc  If I'm waiting in line at the bar and a few hockey players show up I totally expect them to go through VIP and get in before me  I don't care cause there's only a few of them and it's a big bar  It's pretty easy to sit and home and cry about not going to the bar though cause there might be a celebrity there and he/she might get in before me  I hope people turn their heads to something important soon like the biggest recession we've had in decades  Report this comment!",,,,,,$$$

Regardless it was a stupid decision on the part of AHS  I saw Jerome Iginla on the news trying to justify the idea by mentioning that they come in contact with a lot of kids  I like Jerome but something tells me that teachers come in contact with more kids in any given day than the Flames do  Check the box seats next game to see who's sitting there!!!!

You can't blame the Flames (keep in mind I'm an Oilers fan)  All they did was ask Alberta Health Services are the ones that made the mistake  That being said as a PR move the Flames management should send their players to all the various clinics to sign autographs and talk to kids that are waiting in line  Report this comment!report this comment

Everyone should get of the Flames back  This problem should be directed at Alberta Health Services only! The Flames management called and aske3d if they could be helped out and they were  If they would have been turned down or told no   end of story  Anyone of us would have been happy if our company or employer hooked us up    every person would have said thanks    who wants to wait in line? You know that the only reason why this story was made public is because Alberta's Premier's opposition found out and wanted to cause problems!!! POLITICAL PROPAGANDA!

I think the entire Flames organization should be embarassed little children and elderly sick people who very well could die from this illness have been turned away  yet elite atheletes with no chance of serious ill effects if they get the flu are given the shot  If one person dies here there should be someone held accountable and the government people involved should all be let go  Elite athletes given the shot just so they can play a game while others have to worry about survial if they get the swine flu this is a real travesty and the people involved should dealt with  To the Calgary Flames  i hope you can live with yourselves  a terrible display especially when some of the people who are sick and actually need the shot used to cheer and support your team  In a word ASHAMED       Darren Report this comment!report this comment

The Flames made a request to have the team shots at a private clinic in which their TEAM doctors supervised  I recently went travelling and I was given the H1N1 shot in my doctor's office before travelling  I guess I am special too because I have Alberta Health Care    Normally I hate the Flames but this was a terrific decision  They travel to many cities and took steps to stop the spread of what is being called a pandemic  How in the World do the Flames get bad press for taking preventative measures? And as for a private clinic   well duh! Local celebs in a crowd of thousands?

Ok to fill in all those of you from outside Alberta    Govt botched dispersal of vaccine BIG TIME   the Health Minister Ron Liepert took NO responsibility and shuffled it all to Alberta Health Sevices   even though the distribution of the vaccine was ultimately a govt  mandate  Liepert and his sidekick Stephen Duckett have deflected all responsibility for this fiasco even though at end of the day Liepert is ultimately accountable for his portfolio which is of course Health Care  The fact that a senior staff member was fired is a 'token' act and does not show leadership but in fact cowardice by the Minister and the Government  Ultimately the only person who should lose his job over this WHOLE vaccine debacle in Alberta is Liepert  He reaps the rewards of his position (large salary benefits many perks) but is not man enough to take responsibility for the complete failure of his department to fulfill there duties to the public of Alberta  In short this is not about the Flames or the one person fired but about a govt led by Ed Stelmach which has become completely and utterly disconnected from its constituents   sorry for the political rant but people need to understand this is MUCH bigger than about the Flames all this incident has done is make the whole country aware of what an embarassment Alberta is becoming    Report this comment!report this comment

Prisioners also got the H1N1 shot and didn't have to wait in line   and thats a LOT more shots (thousands?) than the Calgary Flames (hundreds?)took away from the 'high risk' people  Prisoners don't play in front of 20000 healthy fans including pregnant women and kids every other night like the Flames (or any sports team)do    nevermind the airports and so forth they use frequently with a high volume of people   also which prisoners do not  Not saying it's right    but there are bigger fish to fry than a sports team if this is an issue for Alberta  At the very least don't blame the Flames   they too have young families and pregnant wives who are 'high risk' and the players are very high risk given their travel/exposure to the public to get the virus  So they may not be worried about themselves getting H1N1 and dying but they don't want their preganant wives/young children to get infected especially by THEM  They would be dumb to say no if offered the shot and have a young family/pregnant wife at home  Do prisoners have these risks?? As a side note   Could you also imagine the fuss if the Calgary Flames showed up in line for the flu shot?

read the second comment in the story  'rolling out office flu shots is a good thing    ' the Flames didn't do anything different  from a strictly business point of view they are trying to protect their employees  was it handled in the best way possible probably not  and i am a flames fan  but the morality of it isn't questionable  look at it as any other company trying to protect their employees  now some people will argue then they should've got shots for every person who works for the Flames but there is no way AHS would've agreed to that  they only allowed the players to get it for the reason that Ken King listed  the organization is just trying to protect it's most high risk employees which are the players  that is a fact  you can argue the manner in which they went about it and the morality of it but if you look at this from a strictly business POV it isn't any different from any other large company  Report this comment!report this comment

Oh no they got there shots first? What next? If someone breaks a bone on the team will they get to see a doctor right away too? or if they get concussed? Can't believe a professional athlete gets to see doctors first! Next they won't have to stand in line to get into a club or they might not have to make reservations to get into a restaurant!

I agree with some of you guys  I don't blame the Flames players or organization one bit even though the optics certainly aren't in their favor  They only did what any of us would do if we 'knew a guy' in the system who could hook us up  I'm sure tons of businesses that care about their employee's productivity - I mean welfare -are scrambling to get needles into arms asap  It's the responsibility of public health officials to put up the roadblocks form policy establish procedures and generally organize a mass vaccination in a reasonable fair manner  This requires public oversight and media scrutiny  And there will be mis-steps intentional or otherwise like this situation  I'm sure there is a bit of scapegoatism going on but with such a high-profile issue that's inevitable  We can assess moral blame all we want ultimately what matters is establishing a working fair vaccination system for H1N1 or the next pandemic scare  Report this comment!report this comment

I don't agree with what they did but whatever it's done now  What offends me more is some peoples generalizations and ignorance  I can't count the times I read things like 'If your company did it you'd be first in line'  These are the uneducated people who have no idea the swine flu has already been the subject of pandemic amd mass hysteria at least twice before resulting in deaths from the vaccine given to prevent it  I for one have never and will never get a flu shot of any kind  Padding the pockets of a pahrmaceutical company while they inject chemicals and toxins into my system?    no thanks  I'll leave that to the sheep on this board that believe everything the media crams down thier throats  I'll bet the farm that in the future we'll find H1N1 was the product of something similar to the Donald Rumsfeld connection to the avian flu scare  It's always about $$$  Report this comment!report this comment

Let's see the Flames requested immunization from Alberta Health Services their request was met and then one un-named health staffer is fired  This is a cover-up at the very top and if it isn't please name the staffer that was fired and then ask how many million dollars he/she recieved in his/her severance package? Corruption at the top and Duckett Leipert Stelmach and the conservatives need to be got rid of as well! You can't blame the Flames that their request to Alberta Health Services was granted! I see a landslide coming for the Wildrose Alliance party in the next provincial election! Get this I'm a Health care worker whom has been exposed now to this virus on several occasions by patients with confirmed H1N1 in my hospital and I still have not been offered the shot until this very day today! Shows how much Alberta Health cares for their staff does it not? Not to mention the potential to spread through hospitals and then out again into the community via our close contacts and families! I smell several rats in our legislature and upper eschalons of provincial government! P S I won't be taking the shot now because I've already been exposed and sick so what is the point as I have already built immunity to it! I'm just so glad that the Alberta Health and the Alberta Government values their healthcare employees their families and all their potential contacts as much as they do! This government needs to be taken down if not now definitely in the next election! Go Albertans Go! Report this comment!report this comment

For those who say that the individual team members were not morally wrong   wake up! They knew of the shortage as it was announced days before  The captain especially should be setting an example here and saying 'I should wait in line like everyone else' but he didn't and a role model for this he ain't  The players are at fault just as much as management unless they admit that they are puppets  They each had a voice to do what was right  I say boycott or at least boo them off the ice come friday  They need to know that the people of Alberta do not take kindly to playing favorites when it comes to health  Report this comment!

You all realize of course that in Alberta ANYONE had the option of being vaccinated not just pregnant women and children  I know plenty of healthy middle aged men who got the vaccine before the government admitted there wasn't enough to go around should they all be booed and petitioned and punished?

Let me answer you by saying if I had to choose between an Olympic gold medal and the life of a child I'll take the child  This scapegoating is as much B S  as the players pretending that they were all unaware of the vaccine shortage  Seriously do the government officials really want us to believe that something like this can happen under their noses without them noticing? Do the players really want us to believe that they are so out of touch that they and their families all missed ALL the media coverage of the H1N1 vaccine shortages? They have to decide whether they are selfish for knowingly jumping the line or too stupid to have noticed they were jumping the line  Report this comment!report this comment

And just how many of you that are complaining will even get the H1N1 shot anyways? Do any of you even bother to get the yearly flu shot? I'll bet most of you are complaining simply because it's fashionable to be outwardly jealous and hostile to anyone with more money or fame than you  Report this comment!report this comment

This is a serious matter and it should not be sugar coated 

I am in my 50s and all people my age were able to be vaccinated against polio 

But I have have had 2 co-workers over the years my age who had polio and who now have post-polio syndrome 

Why?

Because their parents did not trust vaccines 

The good thing about this flu vaccine as compared with the polio vaccine is if your child get seriously sick because of your fear of vaccines you won't have to explain why to your child why they have to live their lives crippled  They'll just be dead 

It is your choice as a parent 

It is also your responsibility if you make the wrong decision 

Don't panic  But do think about what sources of information you are basing your decisions on the life and death of your child on 

If you are relying on information from the internet I urge you to use the official websites of hospitals and medical clinics 

For example:

Is the successful completion of high school mathematics not a prerequisite for a BN or MD degree?

Winnipeg has 700000 people  About 1/3 are willing to be vaccinated now (without waiting to see how bad the flu epidemic becomes) 

We should be vaccinating those people with 10 days so that the 2 weeks can pass for the vaccine to work and so we have the decks cleared for the other 2/3 of Manitobans if they decide to get vaccinated 

That means they should be vaccinating (700000 / 3 / 10 =) 23300 people per day in Winnipeg

Ahhhh! Everyone should stop getting their information from dot com sites! Yes vaccinations do rarely cause GB syndrome- but more often GB syndrome is caused by viral infections! And yes healthy young adults are becoming seriously ill with H1N1- the average age of those needing life support this last Spring was 32!! Is no one out there happy that they don't have Polio???? None of us have Polio because of a vaccine!!! For those who refuse to put anything toxic in their bodies- are you telling me you never smoked a cigg? drank a beer took an antibiotic microwaved your food in a ziploc container???

If you choose to not get the vaccination then fine but stop spreading lies! And stay home when you get sick! I work at St  B ER and it seems that everyone thinks that the staying home when sick rule applies to everyone but themselves!

@formerpeg   would like to know where you got your information from in regards to healthy people dropping dead like you say they are Of all the deaths I heard about they were never sure in how healthy this individuals were in the first place And also please explain to me in why I know of so many health professionals that are not getting the shot  I agree with @tony   the risks are very small if you are a healthy person already You may get the flu but it may only be mild and it won't kill you

    I'd also reccommend to be extremly careful and suspicious towards this flu shot  Even our doctor a recognized german expert on influenza and the strongest promoter of the seasonal flu shot i've ever met said he'll refuse to use this new one  It's not sufficiently tested and not save to use

    This might be the Endgame where the plutocrats desiring to sterilize or kill us through “vaccinations” are making their move  Perhaps  If so it also might polarize the “white hats” among that group to have a Darth Vader/Professor Snape/Scrooge conversion to act for love and all of humanity  It’s amazing drama that’s for sure

•	While there's little doubt that MF59 would increase the response to 2009 H1N1 vaccination in people there's a layer of complication here that makes this data less alarming than at first it seems 

Specifically most adults aren't as naive about flu -- in an immunological sense of course -- as the mice used in the Dormitzer report  And while the 2009 H1N1 doesn't appear to be recognized by antibodies specific for the pre-pandemic H1N1 strains it's possible that CD4 help might cross-react and this might support better antibody responses to a single-shot of 2009 H1N1 vaccine  And of course wouldn't help the naive young 

Lots more needs to be -- and is being -- done

•	Given the proven efficacy of various adjuvants in allowing dose reductions with specifically flu vaccines   the reluctance of various companies to adopt the strategy seems puzzling  Until you realise that use of ANY adjuvant requires a whole new set of clinical trials 

Seems to me that everyone should bite the bullet NOW and determine which to use - because the old technology used for flu vaccine production is straining to provide enough for just the northern hemisphere let alone for the next flu season in the south! We of course have mostly lived through the current winter flu season pandemic: you folk still have it coming

•	Attorney Jim Turner is filing a lawsuit in Washington D C  against the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in an effort to halt the distribution of the swine flu vaccine in America  The lawsuit charges that the FDA violated the law in its hasty approval of four swine flu vaccines by failing to scientifically determine neither the safety nor efficacy of the vaccines 

“The suit will seek an injunction against the FDA from approving the vaccine” attorney Jim Turner told Natural News on Thursday evening’s Natural News Talk Hour show  “And the core of the argument is that they have not done the proper safety and efficacy tests on the vaccine to allow it to be release at this time ”

Vaccine/Adjuvant combination has never been properly tested:

The vaccine/adjuvant combination being referred to as the “swine flu vaccine” has apparently never been safety tested or approved by the FDA  In fact in many cases the vaccine is being sent to clinics pharmacies and other health establishments separately from the adjuvant chemical leaving it up to each local vaccine retailer to properly mix the vaccine with the adjuvant according to information provided by Turner  With hundreds of millions of Americans potentially being targeted with this vaccine the potential for improper mixing improper dosages and human error is alarming 

Normally when a pharmaceutical achieves “FDA approved” status there is a considerable paper trail of scientific scrutiny peer review clinical trials and other supporting evidence  To our knowledge no such documents exist for the swine flu vaccines  The FDA’s approval of these vaccines appears to be based entirely on a whim 

“What has been tested?” asked attorney Jim turner  “Where has it been tested? Who reviewed the test? Who looked at the test and said yes they proved safety and efficacy? There is no record that we can find that shows these things have been done ”
By approving the four vaccines in the absence of such safety testing the FDA itself stands in direct violation of federal law  “There is a law that they’re supposed to follow and they are not following it” Turner added

Of all the vaccines A(H1N1) vaccines approved for use in the U S  and or North America three of them contain SQUALEEN (oil&water) based ADJUVANTS they are: GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Prepandrix  An Egg based production split cell virus containing the GSK (AS03) adjuvant  GSK boasts that more than 40000 adults/children have received AS03 adjuvanted vaccines during development of seasonal & pandemic vaccines  Next in the line up is the Sanofi-Aventis vaccine - Humenza  Formulated to contain 3 8 mcg hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) v–like virus and includes AF03-ADJUVANT  Sanofi Pasteur’s proprietary adjuvant is aimed at stimulating the immune system to increase its response  And last but not least is the infamous MF59 ADJUVANT which many Gulf War Veterans can possibly relate to  The Novartis vaccine Celtura® which was tested with 100 healthy volunteers aged between 18 and 50 contains the MF59® adjuvant which was well tolerated pain at the injection site the most frequent adverse event 

So profvrr what do you suspect your government's (HSS) gonna do with the 415 million worth of ADJUVANT they purchased with FEDERAL RESERVE NOTES    make salad dressings?

•	The adjuvant being used in Canada is GlaxoSmithKline's AS03  I've
found several clinical studies comparing safety of influenza vaccine
with and without this adjuvant and the only side effect specific to
the vaccine appears to be increased pain at the injection site  These
studies have involved several thousand individuals it's hard to
predict what will happen when millions receive the adjuvant but based
on these results I would take the adjuvanted vaccine

•	The Canadian aduvanted H1N1 vaccine will be available on Monday  A colleague mentioned that his md disclosed that a single dose would not provide adequate protection since it is 1/5th as strong as the unadjuvanted American vaccine  Can anyone speak to this? I have a hard time believing that Health Canada would give deliberately dilute vaccinations for the purpose of reducing the intensity of the illness without clearly stating that purpose  Am I wrong?

My second question is about whether or not there is any truth to the rumors that squalene one of the adjuvants has been linked to either infertility rheumatoid arthritis or Gulf War Syndrome  There was an intellectual property patent for a pet population induced fertility vaccine showing online but my assumption was that squalene was added for the same reason it is added to any vaccine to boost the immune system response  Am I wrong?

My last question is that I read in the Globe and Mail that flu vaccines are not required to undergo human trials each year  So what type of testing do they undergo then?

•	The adjuvanted Canadian H1N1 vaccine contains 3 75 micrograms of HA while the non-adjuvated US vaccine contains 15 micrograms  The point of the adjuvant is to allow less antigen to be used  The Canadian vaccine has been tested in adults and been shown to induce a protective antibody response in over 90% of recipients  So the answer is 3 75 micrograms of HA plus adjuvant will provide adequate protection  I'll answer the other two questions separately

Canadian vaccine trials started this week and the results won't be available until next year 

In the meantime Canada's health regulator is relying on worldwide experience with producing flu vaccines and small European studies to approve the use of the vaccine in Canada

•	Thanks for the info Profvrr  I'm researching what to do for my 6month old and 2 year old children  Everything I'm looking at shows little confirmation in safety in the adjuvant's use in children  The canadian government recommends the adjuvant vaccine but there is an option to use the unadjuvant vaccine in children  I'm wondering if this the same as a non adjuvant vaccine used by the Americans and if it is as effective as the adjuvant vaccine

•	With respect to testing of seasonal flu vaccines: in the US the FDA does not require clinical trials of the new vaccine that is produced each year because they are made using the same manufacturing process except that the virus is slightly different (change in HA and NA antigens)  The vaccines are tested for antigen content sterility and safety in a variety of laboratory animals

•	Thank you for answering all of my questions  Just thought I would add one additional comment  My family and I had the H1N1 adjuvanted vaccine yesterday and I ended up spending the night in emergency (surrounded by H1N1 patients) being monitored for an adverse reaction classified as oculo respiratory syndrome  Go figure! Apparently this symptom is rare but there have been clusters of people reporting it in our province (AB) and the neighboring province (BC)  as well I have to say everyone whoI have spoken with who had the shot yesterday agrees that their arm is much sorer than the regular flu shot

•	My wife and I had the Canadian adjuvenated H1N1 flu shots yesterday  Her arm was a a bit sore for a while  My arm was not  we had no other reactions  We are both 66 years old  We had the regular seasonal flu shot a few weeks earlier  Her arm was sore for a week  Me nothing  She thinks the doctor put the needle in differently the first time  The doctor said the adjuvant is fish oil and vitamin E which probably causes some local irritation and thereby provokes a faster and stronger immune reaction  

I think people here are over reacting to micro possibilities of possible problems  For example you get more Hg in a can of tuna than a lifetime of flu shots  How does Janice know that she wouldn't have had a swollen eyelid even if she didn't get the a flu shot? Out of a population of 100000 in a normal week without flu or flu shots how many will get sick and die? Have allergic reactions? And how many more will there be if they all get the flu? And how many more or less if they all get flu shots? Maybe by worrying about these things people are trying to create a fantasy of having more control over life than reality allows?

•	Influence on the medical profession:
The medical profession has largely abdicated its responsibility to educate medical students and doctors in the use of prescription drugs  Drug companies now support most continuing medical education medical conferences and meetings of professional associations  Although they call it education the billions of dollars they put into it comes out of their marketing budgets  The industry also provides students house officers and physicians in practice with meals trips to exotic locations and many other blandishments  Although medical and industry associations have issued guidelines that would limit these gifts codes of conduct are entirely voluntary and full of loopholes 

Influence on government:
The pharmaceutical industry has the largest lobby in Washington DC — there are more pharmaceutical lobbyists there than members of Congress — and it gives copiously to political campaigns  As a result the prescription drug legislation and policies that come out of Washington are usually made to order for the industry

Given that this fact turns out to be accurate the effects of toxins absorbed through the GI tract are quite different in their short and long term effects than those entering the blood stream directly? Those having direct entry to the humeral system (systemic circulation) are not subjected to HCL digestive enzymes nor 
macrophage activity which probably alters the eventual humeral response

•	A clinical trial in Europe by GlaxoSmithKline showed 98 per cent of adults receiving a single shot containing 5 25 micrograms of vaccine and the company's AS03 adjuvant had a spike in antibody levels thought to signal protection

Squalene in an adjuvant formulation known as MF59 the secret ingredient in certain lots of experimental anthrax vaccine caused devastating autoimmune diseases and death in countless Gulf War vets including Canadian British and Australian troops also injected with squalene laced vaccine  It continues to be used today 
This adjuvant contributed to the cascade of reactions called “Gulf War syndrome ” 
The symptoms they developed included arthritis fibromyalgia chronic fatigue chronic headaches dizziness neuropsychiatric problems anti-thyroid effects systemic lupus erythematosus multiple sclerosis and ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) also known as Lou Gehrig's disease  http://www whale to/vaccine/west_edda html

Just one more flu vaccine 
The same manufacturer will be making the same vaccine and it's just considered as a (strain) switch  Health Canada the U S  Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) intend to treat the pandemic vaccine as a supplement or amendment to existing flu vaccines licences 

Governments and their vaccine regulators realized that if pandemic vaccines were treated like a brand new vaccine - The pandemic would be over before the pandemic flu shots would be injected into anyone 

Swine influenza in the U S  in early 1976 led to fears a pandemic was emerging  More than 40 million people in the U S  were vaccinated  The pandemic never materialized roughly 500 people developed Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) and about 25 deaths were attributed to the vaccination program

•	No offense intended: I'm simply not in favour of vaccines at all  This includes the notion of whether they provide protective immunity  I do know this however when the Japanese health department adjusted their vaccine schedules for infant children whereby they delayed administering vaccines to children under six years of age the incidence of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) dropped by more than 50% 

I'm more inclined on a cleaner environment in which people are required to live  And I also believe that we can all benefit immunologically from healthier diets consisting of foods that actually contain nutritional value  So I'll say it here right now I think the idea that Bill Microsoft Gates has in regard to GM (genetically modified) Foods for the African continent was as good of an idea as was his VISTA  If the foods that we are expected to eat cannot support it's own seeds then how will it be able to support us?

Some other info found during my search to find this material (data) for you:
http://www vaclib org/basic/japanusa htm

(d) JAPAN In 1975 about 37 Crib Sudden Deaths were linked to vaccination in Japan  Doctors in one prefecture boycotted vaccinations and refused to vaccinate  The Japanese government paid attention and stopped vaccinating children below the age of two years  When immunization was delayed until a child was 24 months of age Sudden Infant Death cases and claims for vaccine related deaths disappeared  Japan zoomed from a high 17th place in infant mortality rate to the lowest infant mortality rate in the world when they stopped vaccinating 
http://www consumerhealth org/articles/display    

Delay of DPT immunization until 2 years of age in Japan has resulted in a dramatic decline in adverse side effects  In the period of 1970-1974 when DPT vaccination was begun at 3 to 5 months of age the Japanese national compensation system paid out claims for 57 permanent severe damage vaccine cases and 37 deaths  During the ensuing six year period 1975-1980 when DPT injections were delayed to 24 months of age severe reactions from the vaccine were reduced to a total of eight with three deaths  This represents an 85 to 90 percent reduction in severe cases of damage and death  (Ref21) ---Raymond Obomsawin MD

•	The US inactivated flu vaccine does not contain squalene  That's a component of the AS03 adjuvant used in the Canadian vaccine  Mercury is only present as thimerosal in multi-dose vaccine vials  There is no link between either component and autism or Guillain-Barré syndrome  Multiple studies involving many children have shown this  As for the 'swine flu problem' the fact that few people have immunity to this new strain makes it more dangerous than seasonal flu  Even if the mortality rate is the same as seasonal flu because many more people will be infected means that many will die  Individuals under 30 pregnant women and those with certain medical conditions are at risk  Of course pharmaceutical companies benefit as they do by selling many other therapeutics  But the public also benefits because infectious diseases are avoided

•	There is an awful lot of media and internet rumour about the immunisations but the facts are this:

There are two swine flu vaccines which have been licenced by the EU  One being Pandemrix the other Calvepan  

Both vaccines contain dead virus which your body's immune system then produces antibodies to  If you are subsquently exposed to the swine flu virus your immune system already has the antibodies to fight it off 

Pandemrix contains an adjuvant called squalene which assists the immune system in producing antibodies  Many vaccines utilise adjuvants other than squalene 

The only other vaccine to use squalene as an adjuvant is Fluad  Thishas been used in Italy over the past 10 years  Only given to vaccinate those over the age of 65 so far 22 million doses have been given apparently without serious side effect 

Squalene is a naturally occuring substance present in both humans and animals  The apparent concern is that when injected it can increase the risk of triggering auto immune disorders  These effects have been previously noted in animal vaccines  The other concern is reportedly during the Gulf war soldiers were given anthrax vaccines which supposedly contained squalene though this has since been denounced as false 

So the facts are a) Squalene is a relatively untested addition to the Pandemrix vaccine
b) The only known subjects to have received squalene containing vaccines are the over 65 age group
c) There is a non-adjuvant vaccine (Calvepan) but the NHS is not utilising it
d) The USA does not licence squalene as a adjuvent
e) The ordinary season flu vaccines given each autumn do not contain adjuvants

So draw your own conclusions! I think so much of modern life anyway is full of chemicals from the fumes we inhale cosmetics and pesticides etc that this probably won't make a significant difference to our already unnatural lifestyles

Here is some more information and it clearly states that the FDA did find Squalene in the Anthrax vaccines used to vaccinate many soldiers   during the Gulf War/Desert Shield/Storm theater of operations 

I also read and have to agree that some creative measures were put into play to otherwise try and explain and perhaps more importantly for some dispel the findings of the Squalene in those actual anthrax vaccine lots which were discovered to contain it

•	Hi there my physician says the adjuvanted vaccine in Canada provides cross-immunity to mutations of H1N1 virus but not the the unadjuvanted one  I'm trying to decide which one to give to my 16 month old son  He also said the immunity won't be as good with the unadjuvanted one even after two doses! Does this mean many kids in his age group are not well protected in the states because there is no adjuvanted vaccine there? Is the Canadian population better protected against mutations of this virus? Thank you

•	Did you not read in the Canadian news recently   They're dumping a bunch of VACCINES supposedly because of expiry dates and refrigeration issues and bla bla bla 
The stuff that they are getting rid of is the vaccine formula with the adjuvant added???

Listen to the interview between Dr  Mercola and Dr  Larry Palevsky via the link I posted above this   do your physician a big favour and send him a copy of it too  

As of November 12 2009 the PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCY of CANADA reports a total of 61 deaths having occurred from swine flu in Ontario  It may however still be reasonable to question whether all the deaths are directly attributable to the swine flu (H1N1) 

In order to keep things in a more manageable perspective and thus hopefully reduce some of the stresses caused by this pandemic I have created a few simple statistics based on some reports 

The 61 Ontario H1N1 deaths are said to have had a start date of April this year  This translates to almost nine deaths per month 

Now lets re-visit some other statistics of death and to which are associated with just one city in Ontario   Toronto 

In the year 2000 a report that was conducted and released by the Toronto public health department (TPHD) and titled: “Air Pollution Burden of Illness in Toronto” concluded that 1000 people die every year prematurely and its due to air pollution (poisoning) 

In the year 2004 a similar study was again carried out by TPHD but this time it indicated that there was an increase in these premature deaths to a new estimated total of 1700 every year 

These numbers conservatively equate to an increase of 175 new deaths per year  And to further break down the numbers to a monthly value would mean 15 new deaths per month over the course of the 48 months between the two studies 

It may therefore be safe and conservative again to assume that 2500 people are perhaps now dying every year from illnesses due to poor air quality  This estimate will therefore further translate to the staggering amount of 215 deaths per month simply from drawing life's breath while living to death in Toronto 

Dr  Perry Kendall a British Columbia health officer is hopeful and believes due to specific evidence that the H1N1 (Swine Flu) virus has peaked in his province 

In categorizing the depth of this pandemic: Dr  Richard Schabas Ontario's former chief medical officer “believes this one to be a dud ”

Reports filed just last week are now showing that $1 5 Billion dollars was so far spent for the swine flu response in Canada  Ultimately this has all been due to the World Health Organization and its redefinition or establishing of their “new Pandemic criteria ""

All adverse reactions are linked to the version of the vaccine that contains an adjuvant a chemical additive that stretches supply and boosts immunity 

David Jensen a spokesman for the Ontario health ministry said there have been 346 adverse events associated with the H1N1 vaccine in the province

•	The Canadian Press-November 19 2009 - Batch of H1N1 vaccine pulled 
“Canadians can be assured that to date the frequency of serious reactions is less than 1 per 100000 doses distributed which is what we've seen with other vaccines” said Dr  Butler-Jones - CANADA""S CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER (CMO) 

“It is a serious thing that has the potential to kill” according to a CTV report but do not worry: “leading experts insist the benefits of the H1N1 vaccine vastly outweigh the risks ”

A new development in the H1N1 Vaccine Saga is unfolding in Canada 
Whereas health officials are pushing for an acceleration of the vaccination program there is evidence of so-called “unusual adverse reactions” including three recently recorded deaths directly resulting from the vaccine 

In the meantime health authorities have called for the withdrawal of 170000 (higher risk) doses of the vaccine produced by GlaxoSmithKline  
The initiative of which the importance is being downplayed is said to have come from the manufacturer GlaxoSmithKline which expressed concern on higher than normal adverse reactions to the vaccine 

The government is involved in a cover-up  The initial headlines stated “more than 100000 doses” but then read on the number is 170000 doses 

The CTV report admits that “it is a serious thing it has the potential to kill” 
Too Late to Withdraw the 170000 Defective Doses 

The question is whether the doses can be withdrawn or whether they have already been used  

The first news reports from Manitoba indicate that:
Of the 63000 doses shipped [to Manitoba] only 630 remained unused by the four regional health authorities in Manitoba that received them  (Ibid)

This report would suggest that the risky GSK vaccine doses have already been used 

A subsequent report confirms that out of the 63000 doses 900 unused doses of the H1N1 were withdrawn by health authorities “after health authorities received word other vaccines from the same batch have been causing higher rates of allergic reactions than expected ” (Flu vaccine batch pulled in Manitoba | Manitoba | News | Winnipeg Sun 20 November 2009)

http://www upi com/Health_News/2009/09/14/Docs-   

H1N1's foreign origins and unusual gene mix frustrate doctors 

So a St  Jude research team in efforts to speed up the process in making a vaccine ""injects chicken eggs with H1N1 and other viruses"" in an attempt to create hybrids or mutations  

H1N1 is a result of the re-assortment of genes from swine birds and humans with pigs serving as the ""mixing vessel"" scientists said  

H1N1 virus grows half as quickly as many other flu viruses 

My question is if the process of growing the virus is so slow how was it that they had vaccines ""rolling out"" shortly after this news report??? 

Something stinks in Denmark and it ain't their rotten vaccinated chicken eggs either!!!

Is it just me or does Dr  Anne Schuchat of the CDC appear to be trying to get an OSCAR for her facial expressions in trying her hardest to show emotions in just the right places at the right times   she is soooo scripted

But more than four times as many people are killed each year by common Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID)   painkillers like IBUPROFEN and ASPIRIN

Conservative calculations estimate that approximately 107000 patients are hospitalized annually for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-related gastrointestinal (GI) complications and at least 16500 NSAID-related deaths occur each year among arthritis patients alone

Do these 16 500 deaths from LEGAL DRUG matter or is hysteria from swine flu the only thing that counts?

•	My two year old son had an asthma attack (first ever) 3 days after receiving his second dose of H1N1 vaccine  Every week or so since he's gotten hives when exposed to things he was not previously allergic to (peanut butter and cats)  Granted those are common allergens but he was not allergic to peanuts previously and was only mildly allergic to cats - now he seems to suddenly be much more allergic to both  Have you seen any data on asthma and allergy effects due to ""hyper-immunity"" caused the H1N1 vaccine or adjuvant?

•	my son Michael was born on December 1983  throughout these years he never had an allergic reactions to the food he eats regularly everyday as well as taking those annual flu vaccines including taking antibiotics whenever he needs it  however - when he got injected with the swine flu H1N1 vaccine last December 2009 a side effect occured more than (2) weeks after getting the injection  Michael began to experienced itchy skin on his arms legs and feet  this is the first time that something serious like this skin problems happened to him and it all started more than (2) weeks after having been injected with the swine flu H1N1 vaccine  Michael is now suffering from the adverse effect of scratching his itchy skin rashes that flared up which lead to an open infected wounds  on January 8 2010 we went to see his family doctor  he was prescribed 200 gm 2% Clindamycin in Ectosone 0 1% cream to stop the itching and help the wounds to heal  the itching stop for awhile - but recurred again on Wednesday  February 17 2010  we decided to see another doctor for a secong opinion and this time on Thursday Feb  18 2010 the same medicine was prescribed only stronger in tablet form (novo-clindamycin 300 mg)  it help a little bit but on March 4 2010 the same itching occured again  MIchael can't help scratching the old wounds and now he has opened wounds that are infected  the Clindamycin that was previously prescribed by (2) different doctors is not working and so I was force to get a third opinion  this time when went to another family doctor last Monday April 5 2010  he was precribed Apo-Cephalex 250 mg tablet and 30 gm Fucidin cream to kill the bacteric to help heal the wounds  Michael is now waiting to see an specialist (Dermatologist) to hopefully find and fix the problem  the reason - I am sharing you this problem - is to try to find a way to help Michael as urgently as possible  If you can help please let me know via e-mail so I can share it with the proper channels  Michael needs medical help and I am doing the best I can to assist him with your guidance  all I know is that what whatever is happening to Michael started more than (2) weeks after getting the H1N1 swine flu shot  I was wondering if the swine flu H1N1 vaccine they injected us is a combination of an Antigen adjuvanted with either Aso3 or Squalene which can increase the risk of triggering auto immune disorder in Michael's situation? we didn't suffer any adverse side effect - but Michael did? Thank you

•	Nursing Home Test 'Didn't find' proof immunization stops virus 
Tom Blackwell National Post - March 11 2010

A new Canadian-led study has added to a simmering scientific dispute over flu-shot campaigns concluding that immunizing nursing-home workers does nothing to cut the number of confirmed influenza cases among the homes' elderly residents 

Coming at the end of the largest flu-vaccination campaign in Canadian history the review of previous studies calls for stepped-up research into alternative lower-tech ways to combat the virus such as improved hand washing 

In media interviews last year Dr  Jefferson was quoted as saying he ""can't see any reason"" for vaccinating anyone against flu -- arguing the shots did nothing to save lives -- and that most influenza-vaccine studies are ""rubbish ""

Some HCWs remain unvaccinated because they do not perceive risk doubt vaccine efficacy and are concerned about side effects 

We conclude there is no evidence that vaccinating Health Care Workers (HCWs) prevents influenza in elderly residents in Long Term Care Facilities (LTCFs)

The traditional seasonal flu vaccine may have increased the risk of infection with pandemic H1N1 swine flu according to the results of four new studies by Canadian researchers 

In one study the researchers used an ongoing sentinel monitoring system to assess the frequency of prior vaccination with the seasonal flu vaccine in people diagnosed with H1N1 swine flu in 2009 compared to people without swine flu  The researchers found that seasonal flu vaccination was associated with a 68 percent increased risk of getting swine flu

•	I was wondering too if the swine flu shot would have triggered an autoimmune disorder also in my 15 year old daughter?
