  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of the study is to determine the incidence and severity of acute Graft
      versus Host Disease (GVHD) following human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched related donor
      Hematopoetic Stem Cell(HSC) transplant in patients with blood related cancers who receive
      the combination of tacrolimus and Thymoglobulin as GVHD prophylaxis. The investigators also
      will determine the safety of this combination in the first six months post transplant.

      Secondary goals include determining the time to recovery of white blood cells and platelets
      (engraftment), determining the occurrence of opportunistic infections, defined as infection
      that occurs in people with weakened immune systems and caused by organisms that do not
      normally cause disease (fungal infections, pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), and viral
      infections), estimating the incidence of chronic GVHD at two years and the overall and
      disease free survival at two years.

      Immune response will be assessed by means of immuno-correlative studies both prior to and at
      various points after transplant.

    <description>Intravenous Tacrolimus 0.03 mg/kg/d, beginning day -3,  where day 0 is the day of stem cell infusion or &quot;transplant.&quot;  Intravenous tacrolimus will be discontinued once the participant starts eating, and the drug will then be given orally at a dose of approximately 4 times the intravenous dose. Tacrolimus will be discontinued starting 100 days after transplant unless signs of acute and chronic GVHD develop or if severe toxicity occurs. Thymoglobulin will be given  0.5 mg/kg day-3, Thymoglobulin 1.5 mg/kg day -2, Thymoglobulin 2.5 mg/kg day -1.  Thymoglobulin will be given intravenously over 6 hours.</description>
