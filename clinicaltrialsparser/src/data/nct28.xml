      Objectives:

      Primary objective:

        -  Phase-I: To determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of panobinostat (LBH589) +
           Ifosfamide + Mesna, Carboplatin and Etoposide (ICE) combination

        -  Randomized Phase-II: To estimate the complete response (CR) rate in patients with
           relapsed and refractory classical Hodgkins Lymphoma (HL) receiving ICE versus
           PANOBINOSTAT plus ICE therapy

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of the novel combination of PANOBINOSTAT (LBH589)
           plus ICE versus ICE in patients with relapsed and refractory HL

        -  To estimate the overall response rate (CR + partial response PR)

        -  To estimate the success rate of stem cell collection in patients eligible for stem cell
           transplant

        -  To estimate the percentage of patients who subsequently undergo autologous stem cell
           transplantation (ASCT)

        -  To estimate the event free survival (EFS) at 1 year after randomization

        -  To determine pre-treatment and day 7±1 levels of serum Thymus and activation-regulated
           chemokine (TARC) and correlate the results with treatment response. ( TARC has been
           identified as a lymphocyte-directed CC chemokine that attracts activated T-helper type
           2 (Th2) cells in humans.)

        -  To determine pretreatment expression level of histone deacetylases (HDAC1), HDAC2, and
           pSTAT3 and Signal transducer and activator of transcription protein (pSTAT6) by
           Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and correlate the results with treatment response

      The Study Drugs:

      Panobinostat is designed to block the function of enzymes that are found inside cancer
      cells.  These enzymes trigger cells to grow and multiply out of control.  By blocking these
      enzymes, it may slow down the growth of or kill cancer cells.

      Ifosfamide is designed to slow or stop the growth of cancer cells.

      Carboplatin is designed to interfere with the growth of cancer cells by stopping cell
      division, which may cause the cells to die.

      Etoposide is designed to block cell growth.

      Baseline Tests:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, the following tests and
      procedures will be performed about 7 days before the first dose of the study drug:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your height, weight, and vital
           signs (blood pressure and heart rate).

        -  You will have 1 electrocardiogram (ECG -- a test that measures the electrical activity
           of the heart).

        -  Blood (about 2 1/2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing. Biomarkers are chemical
           &quot;markers&quot; in the blood/tissue that may be related to your reaction to the study drug.

        -  Women who are able to become pregnant must have a negative blood (about 1 1/2
           teaspoons) pregnancy test.

      Study Groups:

      You will be assigned to a study group based on when you join this study.  Up to 2 groups of
      6 participants will be enrolled in the Phase 1 portion of the study. Up to 10 patients will
      be enrolled in an expansion group of Phase 1. Up to 72 participants will be enrolled in
      Phase 2.

      Phase 1:

      If you are enrolled in the Phase 1 portion, the dose of panobinostat you receive will depend
      on when you joined this study.  The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose
      level of panobinostat .  Each new group will receive a higher dose of panobinostat  than the
      group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen.  This will continue until the
      highest tolerable dose of panobinostat is found.

      All participants will receive the same dose level of ICE.

      Once the highest tolerable dose is found, up to 10 extra participants, called the expansion
      group, will receive the study drugs at that dose.

      Phase 2:

      If you are enrolled in the Phase 2 portion, you will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of
      a coin) to 1 of 2 groups.

        -  If you are in Group 1, you will receive ICE.

        -  If you are in Group 2, you will receive ICE and panobinostat. The dose of panobinostat
           will be the highest dose that was tolerated in the Phase 1 portion.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each cycle is 14 days.

      ICE Administration:

        -  On Day 1 of Cycles 1-3, you will receive ifosfamide by vein over 24 hours.

        -  On Day 1 of Cycles 1-3, you will receive carboplatin by vein over 1 hour.

        -  On Days 1-3 of Cycles 1-3, you will receive etoposide by vein over 2 hours.

      You will also receive mesna to help prevent side effects. On Day 1 of Cycles 1-3, you will
      receive mesna by vein over 12 hours.

      If you are in Phase 2, you will also receive pegfilgrastim to help prevent side effects.
      Beginning Day 4 of Cycles 1-3, you will take pegfilgrastim through a needle under the skin.

      Panobinostat Administration:

      If you are in a group that will receive panobinostat, you will take panobinostat by mouth
      starting Day -6 of Cycle 1 (6 days before your first dose of ICE). You will take the
      panobinostat on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday during Cycles 1 and 2 (Days -6, -4, and -2 of
      Cycle 1 and Days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, and 12 of Cycles 1 and 2).

      You should take panobinostat at the same time each morning with 1 cup (8 ounces) of water.
      You should swallow the capsules whole and not chew them.  You must avoid grapefruit or
      grapefruit juice and seville (sour) oranges while on study.

      If you miss a dose of panobinostat, take it as soon as you remember it on the same day.
      However, if more than 12 hours have passed since you were supposed to take the dose, you
      should skip that day's dose.  In that case, wait to take panobinostat until the next
      scheduled dosing day.

      Study Visits:

      Participants in both Phase 1 and Phase 2 will have the following tests and procedures
      performed while they are on study:

      Within 7 days before each ICE therapy:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your height, weight, and vital
           signs.

        -  Blood (about 2 1/2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will be asked if you have had any side effects.

      One (1) time a week, blood (2 1/2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      On Days 1 and 5 of Cycle 1, you will have 2 ECGs.

      On Day 7 of Cycle 1 (±1 day), blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing.
      Biomarkers are chemical &quot;markers&quot; in the blood/tissue that may be related to your reaction
      to the study drug

      On Day 1 of Cycles 2 and beyond, you will have an ECG.

      After Cycle 3:

        -  You will have a CT scan of your head and neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis to check the
           status of the disease.

        -  If your bone marrow was positive at screening, you will have a PET scan to check the
           status of the disease.

      Length of Study:

      You be on study for up to 3 cycles (about 42 days). You will be taken off study early if the
      disease worsens or you experience intolerable side effects.

      End-of-Study Visit:

      After you are off study, you will have an end-of-study visit at which the following will be
      performed:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.

        -  You will have an ECG.

      This is an investigational study.  Panobinostat is not FDA approved or commercially
      available. It is currently being used for research purposes only.

      ICE is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of several types of
      lymphoma, including relapsed and refractory Hodgkins lymphoma.  The combination of
      panobinostat and ICE for the treatment of Hodgkin's lymphoma is investigational.

      Up to 92 patients will take part in this study.  All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.
