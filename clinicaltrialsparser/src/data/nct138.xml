    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether umbilical cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells of
      treatment for diabetic foot is safe and effective in the management of diabetic foot
      ischemia, the therapeutic effect of stem cells is caused by improving blood circulation in
      ischemic limb which would in turn promote ulcer healing, prevent amputation of limb and
      relieve the Sevier pain of ischemia.

      Type 2 diabetic patients with diabetic foot were enrolled and randomized to either
      transplanted group or control group. Patients in transplanted  group received the stem cells
      treatment,Patients in control  group received the standard treatment. After culture in
      vitro, umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells should go through safety evaluation which
      include culture and check of pathogenic microorganisms (bacteria, mycoplasma, chlamydia,
      eumycete and viruses) of the cells medium and karyotype analysis of the mesenchymal stem
      cells. Only the safe cells were harvested and transplanted by multiple intramuscular
      injections into the impaired lower limbs. Follow-up index include: efficacy (pain,ulcer
      healing rate, lower limb amputation rate and ,ankle-brachial index,magnetic resonance
      angiography,electromyogram) and safety (infection of the injection site, fever, and tumour
      generation).
