  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is primarily to assess the safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of clofarabine intravenously administered to pediatric patients with
      relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or for whom no other therapy with
      greater potential clinical benefit exists. The dosing regimen for the intravenous (IV)
      clofarabine is 30 or 52 mg/m2/day for 5 consecutive days. The secondary objectives are to
      document the activity of clofarabine and to explore the impact of deoxycytidine kinase (dCK)
      promoter polymorphism on PK and treatment outcome.

      This is a Phase I Study of Clofarabine in Japanese Paediatric Patients With Relapsed or
      Refractory Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia.

      Subjects will receive intravenous administration of clofarabine at 30 or 52 mg/m2/day (2
      hours) for 5 consecutive days and then the administration will be withheld until Day 14.  If
      there is no evidence of recovery in neutrophil (≥750/mm3) and/or platelet count
      (≥50,000/mm3), the therapy may be withheld up to Day 42.  However, in the absence of
      progression based on the judgment of the investigator after each cycle of treatment and the
      benefit of continued treatment is judged to exceed the risk, subjects may receive up to a
      total of six cycles.  If a subject is receiving two or more cycles, a written consent must
      be obtained prior to start of Cycle 2.

      When a subject completes the final dose, the safety will be observed and followed-up for 45
      days after the final study drug administration.

      Cohort 1 will receive 30 mg/m2/day x 5 days at Cycle 1 and will be assessed for
      tolerability.  Samples will be drawn to assess pharmacokinetics at this dose.  If subjects
      do not develop adverse events indicative of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) at Cycle 1, the
      dose will be increased to 52 mg/m2/day x 5 days from Cycle 2 and the subjects will be
      assessed for safety and activity only.

      Cohort 2 will receive 52 mg/m2/day x 5 days at Cycle 1 and will be assessed for the
      tolerability.  Samples will be drawn to assess pharmacokinetics at this dose.

      Whether or not proceeding to Cohort 2 after the Cycle 1 of Cohort 1 is completed will be
      determined by the sponsor based on the assessment of the safety data and the recommendation
      of the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).
