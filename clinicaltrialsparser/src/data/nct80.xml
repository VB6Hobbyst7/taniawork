    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate anti-cancer stem cell (CSC) activity (measured by
      the amount of Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1/ALDH1+ cells before and after treatment) of
      pre-operative bevacizumab in combination with conventional chemotherapy in breast cancer
      receiving neo-adjuvant treatment, compared to a control arm receiving chemotherapy alone.
