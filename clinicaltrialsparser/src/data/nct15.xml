  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 10,000 allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCT) are performed
      annually in the US for various indications. Bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) is the most common
      late noninfectious complication following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant.
      Prognosis of BO in the allogeneic HSCT setting is dismal and there are no therapies proven
      to be consistently effective. The exact incidence is not clear but may be as high as 30%2 .
      Risk factors include new or ongoing chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD), age,
      antecedent obstructive airways disease and viral infections1. BO is characterized
      physiologically by progressive irreversible airflow obstruction and pathologically by
      luminal occlusion of the distal airways due to progressive scarring3. The pathogenesis is
      not completely understood but the cytokine transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-b1),
      important for both tissue repair and fibrosis, is thought to play a pivotal role.
      Bortezomib, an FDA approved proteasomal inhibitor inhibits TGF-b1 signaling in vitro and
      protects against lung injury/fibrosis in bleomycin mouse model as well as in a mouse model
      for skin fibrosis. This is consistent with other data in the literature that proteasomal
      inhibition can prevent the development of fibrosis. Thus the investigators propose to test
      the safety, tolerability and efficacy of bortezomib in chronic pulmonary GVHD (BO).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Voluntary written informed consent before performance of any study-related procedure
             not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn
             by the subject at any time without prejudice to future medical care.

          -  Female subject is either post-menopausal or surgically sterilized or willing to use
             an acceptable method of birth control (i.e., a hormonal contraceptive, intra-uterine
             device, diaphragm with spermicide, condom with spermicide, or abstinence) for the
             duration of the study.

          -  Male subject agrees to use an acceptable method for contraception for the duration of
             the study.

          -  Day &gt;100 after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation

          -  Underlying cancer in remission

          -  Decrease in  FEV1 of ≥12% from the pre-transplant baseline (FEV1/FVC ratio &lt;0.8)

          -  No evidence of acute infection

          -  ANC &gt;1000

          -  Platelets &gt;50,000

          -  Age 18-70

          -  ECOG performance Status 0-2.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has a platelet count of less than 50,000 within 14 days before enrollment.

          -  Patient has an absolute neutrophil count of less 1000 within 14 days before
             enrollment.

          -  Patient has a calculated or measured creatinine clearance of &lt; 20 ml/minute within 14
             days before enrollment.

          -  Patient has Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy within 14 days before enrollment.

          -  Myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to enrollment or has New York Heart
             Association (NYHA) Class III or IV heart failure (see section 8.4), uncontrolled
             angina, severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias, or electrocardiographic evidence
             of acute ischemia or active conduction system abnormalities. Prior to study entry,
             any ECG abnormality at Screening has to be documented by the investigator as not

             (b-hCG) pregnancy test result obtained during screening.  Pregnancy testing is not
             required for post-menopausal or surgically sterilized women.
