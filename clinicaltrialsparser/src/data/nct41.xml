      RATIONALE: Radioisotope therapy, such as iobenguane I 131, releases radiation that kills
      tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin, etoposide, busulfan, and
      melphalan, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells or by stopping them from dividing. A peripheral stem cell transplant may be able to
      replace blood-forming cells that are destroyed by iobenguane I 131 and chemotherapy.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying induction therapy followed by iobenguane I 131 and
      chemotherapy in treating patients with newly diagnosed high-risk neuroblastoma undergoing
      stem cell transplant, radiation therapy, and maintenance therapy with isotretinoin.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To assess the feasibility of treating high-risk neuroblastoma patients, age 365 days to
           30 years, with an induction block of meta-iodobenzylguanidine labeled with iodine-131
           (^131I-MIBG)/irinotecan/vincristine delivered after multi-agent chemotherapy, and
           post-Induction busulfan/melphalan consolidation therapy.

      Secondary

        -  To assess the tolerability of these regimens in these patients.

        -  To assess the response rate of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  To describe the relationship of tumor norepinephrine transporter (hNET) expression with
           ^131I-MIBG uptake at diagnosis and immediately after ^131I-MIBG therapy, and tumor
           response.

        -  To assess the relative reliability of ^123 I-MIBG and 18FDG-PET imaging in assessment
           of tumor activity at diagnosis, after 2 courses of induction chemotherapy, before
           surgical resection and ^131I-MIBG.

        -  To compare detectable tumor burden before and immediate after therapy on the ^123I-MIBG
           diagnostic scan.

        -  To test for the relationship of occurrence of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) to
           dosages of myeloablative consolidation therapy with busulfan/melphalan and whole-body
           radiation dose or delay of radiation clearance due to^131I-MIBG.

        -  To analyze busulfan first-dose pharmacokinetics as measured by area under the curve
           (AUC) and to relate exposure to SOS incidence.

        -  To describe the toxicity of ^131I-MIBG combined with vincristine and irinotecan given
           on a 5-day schedule.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot, multicenter study.

        -  Induction chemotherapy: Patients receive 5 courses of induction therapy.

             -  Courses 1-2: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 15-30 minutes and topotecan
                hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5.

      Patients undergo peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) collection after course 2.

        -  Course 3 and 5: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1-4 and etoposide
           phosphate IV over 1-2 hours on days 1-3.

      Patients undergo surgery to remove remaining tumor following course 5.

        -  Course 4: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1-6 hours on days 1-2 and
           vincristine sulfate IV and doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 24 hours on days 1-3.

      Treatment repeats every 21 days for a total of 5 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients without progressive disease proceed to
      iobenguane I 131 (^131I-MIBG) induction therapy beginning 3-6 weeks after course 5.

        -  Patients receive vincristine IV on day 0, irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on day 0-4, and
           iobenguane I 131 IV over 90-120 minutes on day 1.

             -  Surgery: Patients ùundergo surgery after course 4 or before consolidation therapy.

             -  Consolidation therapy: Within 4-6 weeks after completion of induction therapy,
                patients receive busulfan IV over 2 hours every 6 hours on days -6 to -3 and
                melphalan IV on day -1.

      Patients also complete a questionnaire regarding costs for travel and accommodations during
      therapy.

      Blood samples maybe collected after the first dose of busulfan for pharmacokinetic assays.

        -  Autologous stem cell rescue: Patients undergo infusion of PBSC on day 0.

        -  Radiotherapy: Beginning 28-42 days after peripheral blood stem cell infusion, patients
           undergo 12 fractions of external-beam radiotherapy (2D, 3D-conformal, or
           intensity-modulated) to all areas of residual disease, primary tumor site, and involved
           nodal disease.

        -  Maintenance therapy: Beginning 66 days after transplantation, patients receive oral
           isotretinoin twice daily on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year, every
      6 months for 4 years, and then annually for 5 years.
