  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liver cirrhosis (LC) represents a late stage of progressive hepatic fibrosis characterized
      by distortion of the hepatic architecture and formation of regenerative nodules. The liver
      transplantation is one of the only effective therapies available to such patients. However,
      lack of donors, surgical complications, rejection, and high cost are it`s serious problems.
      The potential for stem cells to differentiate into hepatocytes cells was recently confirmed.
      Particularly, autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (BM-MSC) has been
      demonstrated to decrease MELD score and increase serum albumin in 4 of patients with
      decompensated liver cirrhosis. Therefore, the investigators propose a hypothesis that
      umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSC) can also improve the disease conditions of LC patients,
      particularly reducing the decompensated conditions in these patients.

      Liver cirrhosis (LC) represents a late stage of progressive hepatic fibrosis characterized
      by distortion of the hepatic architecture and formation of regenerative nodules. The liver
      transplantation is one of the only effective therapies available to such patients. However,
      lack of donors, surgical complications, rejection, and high cost are it`s serious problems.

      The potential for stem cells to differentiate into hepatocytes cells was recently confirmed.
      In particular, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (BM-MSC) transplantation has been
      applicated in the clinic for treat several human diseases such as GVHD, cardiac injury and
      brain injury, and displayed good tolerance and efficiency. BM-MSC has also been used to
      treat human liver diseases such as liver failure and liver cirrhosis. In a phase 1 study,
      autologous BM-MSC transplantation has potential to decrease MELD score and increase serum
      albumin in 4 of patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis.

      The purpose of this study is to learn whether and how umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSC)
      can improve the disease conditions in patients with liver cirrhosis. This study will also
      look at how well BM-MSC is tolerated and its safety in LC patients.

      Participants in the study will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms:

      Arm A: Participants will receive 8 weeks of conserved treatment plus UC-MSC treatment.

      Arm B: Participants will receive 8 weeks of conserved treatment plus saline.

      UC-MSC will be prepared according to standard procedures and is collected in plastic bags
      containing anti coagulant. MSCs are given via i.v. under sonography monitoring. After cell
      therapy, patients are followed up at week 4, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 48. The evaluation of some
      clinical parameters such as the level of ascites volume and ascites disappearance rate,
      serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total bilirubin (TB),prothrombin time (PT), albumin
      (ALB), prealbumin(PA), the rountin blood test, renal function test are detected at these
      timepoints. MELD-Na scores and clinical symptoms as well as complication were also observed
      simultaneously.
