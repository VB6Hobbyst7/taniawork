  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM)is characterized by the autoimmune destruction of the
      pancreatic β cells; as a result, patients with T1DM are dependent on exogenous insulin to
      control their blood glucose continuously. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells has
      been shown in many animal studies their potential cure for T1DM,which could not only address
      the need for β-cell replacement but also control of the autoimmune response to cells which
      express insulin. Therefore it is need to study the safety and efficacy of autologous bone
      marrow mesenchymal stem cells in treatment of newly diagnosed patients with T1DM.
