    <textblock>
      The trial is a multi-centre, open-label, safety and tolerability extension trial to the
      IPH2101-101 (previously NN1975-1733) first human dose trial completed with a larger subject
      pool at an optimal dose level. The trial is conducted in elderly Acute Myeloid Leukemia
      (AML) patients over the age of 60 years, in complete remission, and who are not eligible for
      allogeneic stem-cell transplantation.  The dose given to the individual patient will be the
      same as the patient received in the single dose trial IPH2101-101 and 1 mg/kg or 2 mg/kg for
      the 12 patients in an additional cohort.
