  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dietary strategies for alleviating the metabolic complications such as diabetes associated
      with obesity are actively being pursued as alternatives to pharmaceutical interventions The
      genus Vaccinium (e.g. blueberry, blaeberry, cranberry) has been used traditionally as a
      source of folk remedies for established diabetic symptoms, primarily as leaf or stem
      infusions or decoctions. Berries from this family such as blaeberry (BL) and blueberry (BB)
      are enriched in anthocyanins, polyphenolics recognized for their ability to provide and
      activate cellular antioxidant protection, inhibit inflammatory gene expression, and
      consequently protect against oxidant-induced and inflammatory cell damage and cytotoxicity.
      The association of obesity with adipose tissue stress, macrophage recruitment, and
      inflammatory gene expression suggests that eating edible berries from this genus might
      provide an effective alternative or supplementary intervention to attenuate obesity-
      associated inflammation and the associated insulin resistance.

      The aim of this study is to  determine the effects of anthocyanin supplementation in the
      form of a concentrated blaeberry extract on insulin resistance and inflammation particularly
      in the adipose tissue following a three week supplementation period.
