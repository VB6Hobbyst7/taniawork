  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer is a common disease worldwide. It is now thought that colorectal cancer
      cells arise from stem cells where the genetic material regulating growth  and division of
      the stem cell has become defective. This leads to unregulated production of cells which in
      turn have defective genetic information and cancer formation.

      Research into colorectal cancer is hampered by the fact that studies must take a very long
      time to produce results and be very large if the development of a cancer is the endpoint.
      Therefore alternative methods of quantifying the risk of developing a cancer are required so
      trials can be a realistic size and be completed in a realistic time frame. The investigators
      have previously identified several candidates for these 'biomarkers'. The next stage in
      proving or disproving these as useful biomarkers is to test their response to a dietary
      agent that the investigators know reduces the risk of colon cancer.

      This project is designed to enhance understanding of links between food and the health of
      the gut. The particular purpose of the project is to investigate the impact of a
      well-defined intervention in human volunteers on a panel of novel, and established,
      diet-related biomarkers of bowel cancer risk. We have developed a number of novel biomarkers
      of diet-related CRC risk measured in colo-rectal mucosal biopsies (and in stool). These
      biomarkers include differentially expressed proteins, DNA methylation markers and
      inflammation markers. In our on-going BORICC Study we are investigating the relationships
      between dietary exposure and nutritional status for these biomarkers in a cross-sectional
      study. The next logical step in this research is to determine whether a selected panel of
      the most promising biomarkers responds to a dietary intervention i.e. to test their utility
      as biomarkers of GI health and potential as surrogate endpoints in future human studies.

      We propose to use Hi-maize 260 and polydextrose (PD) as our model resistant starch (RS)
      intervention agents.  RS describes the fraction of dietary starch which is not digested in
      the small bowel and which flows to the colon where it is a substrate for bacterial
      fermentation. (Asp, 1996) PD is produced by the bulk melt polycondensation of glucose and
      sorbitol to produce an oligosaccharide with a mean degree of polymerisation of 12 which is
      resistant to mammalian GI enzymes and, like other RSs, is a substrate for bacterial
      fermentation. (Auerbach, 2007) Both Hi-maize and PD are fermented (to a greater or lesser
      extent) producing short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) including butyrate. (Asp, 1996) Butyrate
      has beneficial effects on gut physiology and immune function including anti-inflammatory
      effects. (Wächtershäuser, 2000; Dronamraju, 2009)

      In the present project we will investigate the impact of PD and RS, as food-borne substrates
      for delivery of butyrate, on biomarkers of bowel cancer risk.
