      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, through molecular response and
      event-free survival, about the use of Imatinib in conjunction with chemotherapy after BFM
      &quot;like&quot; Induction in children with ALL Ph+.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnose: therapy-naïve ALL, except for patients that performed Induction for ALL (33
             days) exactly as this protocol and; documented Ph+, to be confirmed by conventional
             cytogenetic - t(9;22) (q34;q11) or FISH and/or gene BCR-ABL presence by RT-PCR or
             FISH.

          2. Female patients of childbearing age, should have pregnancy test (blood βhCG)
             performed before treatment initiation. Effective contraception must be used during
             treatment. Pregnant women won't be included.

          3. Life expectation &gt; 8 weeks.

          4. Medications: antineoplastic treatment-naïve, including corticotherapy, except for
             patients that performed Induction for ALL (33 days) exactly as this protocol.

          5. Signed ICF by child legal responsible.

          6. Laboratory: renal function (serum creatinine ≤ 1,5 x ULN and/or Clearance  ≥70
             ml/min/1,73m2), hepatic function (total bilirubin ≤ 1,5 x ULN, TGP/TGO &lt; 10 x ULN and
             albumin &gt; 2 g/dl.
