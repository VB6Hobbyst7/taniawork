  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MicroRNAs (MiRNAs) regulate the translation of RNAs and are implicated in cell proliferation
      and renewal both under physiologically normal as well as in malignant conditions.
      Dysregulation of specific miRNAs may be associated with either gaining oncogenic or loosing
      tumor suppressing functions.  MiRNA dysregulation has been implicated in breast cancer
      tumorigenic (stem cell) and non-tumorigenic development.  Therefore, miRNA profiling of
      treatment naïve and treatment-exposed breast tumors and sequential samples of blood/serum
      will allow for identification of miRNA markers of prognosis and as indicators and potential
      targets for personalized therapies.  In this proposal, specimens from patients treated in
      the clinical breast cancer program on already existing protocols (IRB 05091 and 05015) will
      be characterized by Dr. Rossi's laboratory and collaborators, and the information gained
      will be applied to develop specific therapies.

      Current neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment strategies do not allow for rationale
      incorporation of such agents.  One needs tools to predict both de novo and acquired
      resistance to therapeutic agents.  This is a difficult task, due to the compound nature of
      escape routes: tumor exposure is usually to a combination of therapeutic agents and the
      mechanisms of resistance are broad: intrinsic resistance due to existing mutations, or
      regulatory - miRNA, other epigenetic - alterations,  polymorphisms, tumor cell adaptation
      via new mutations and activation of alternative pathways, lack of optimal
      pharmacokinetics/genomics, activation of efflux mechanisms, accelerated repair mechanisms
      are involved.

      Similarly, not all patients who are candidates for primary surgical intervention to be
      followed by post-operative adjuvant therapy benefit from such systemic treatments.  The
      mechanisms of resistance be it de novo in surviving stem cell/tumorigenic components, or
      acquired by cells  left behind &quot;dormant&quot; after the surgical intervention, are not well
      delineated.

      Breast tumors subjected to neoadjuvant chemotherapy allow for baseline and
      treatment-effected sampling.  Characterization of core biopsy specimens of primary tumors
      procured prior to exposure to neoadjuvant therapy from different varieties of breast cancer
      subtypes, and of subsequent mid-treatment and intraoperative (procured during definitive
      surgery following completion of neoadjuvant therapy) samples should help to assess the
      predictive value of the pre-treatment and post-treatment miRNA expression profile for
      complete and near complete response, as a surrogate marker for survival.  Similarly,
      patterns of de novo and acquired resistance may emerge when assessment of pre- and post
      treatment miRNA expression profiles are analyzed in a supervised manner of classification
      using pathological response as classifier.  Samples obtained from patients with primary
      surgical removal of their tumors before any systemic treatment exposure on the other hand,
      will allow for determining markers of prognosis, and predictors for response to therapeutic
      targeting agents.

      Tissue and Blood Procurement. Breast cancer tissues from core biopsies (as available,
      preferably fresh frozen or RNA-later preserved, but in case of lack of availability,
      formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded [FFPE] core or tissue samples) which have been collected or
      will be collected under IRB#05091 or 05015.
